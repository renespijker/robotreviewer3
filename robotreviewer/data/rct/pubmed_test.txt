TI  - Cost-effectiveness of intensive v. standard case management for severe psychotic 
      illness. UK700 case management trial. UK700 Group.
PG  - 537-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive case management is commonly advocated for the care of the
      severely mentally ill, but evidence of its cost-effectiveness is lacking. AIMS:
      To investigate the cost-effectiveness of intensive compared with standard case
      management for patients with severe psychosis. METHOD: 708 patients with
      psychosis and a history of repeated hospital admissions were randomly allocated
      to standard (case-loads 30-35) or intensive (case-loads 10-15) case management.
      Clinical and resource use data were assessed over two years. RESULTS: No
      statistically significant difference was found between intensive and standard
      case management in the total two-year costs of care per patient (means 24,550
      Pounds and 22,700 Pounds, respectively, difference 1850 Pounds, 95% CI--1600
      Pounds to 5300 Pounds). There was no evidence of differential effects in
      African-Caribbean patients or in the most disabled. Psychiatric in-patient
      hospital stay accounted for 47% of the total costs, but neither such
      hospitalisation nor other clinical outcomes differed between the randomised
      groups. CONCLUSION: Reduced case-loads have no clear beneficial effect on costs, 
      clinical outcome or cost-effectiveness. The policy of advocating intensive case
      management for patients with severe psychosis is not supported by these results.

TI  - Randomized trial of a depression management program in high utilizers of medical 
      care.
PG  - 345-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: High utilizers of nonpsychiatric health care services have
      disproportionally high rates of undiagnosed or undertreated depression.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of offering a systematic primary care-based
      depression treatment program to depressed "high utilizers" not in active
      treatment. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: One hundred sixty-three
      primary care practices in 3 health maintenance organizations located in different
      geographic regions of the United States. PATIENTS: A group of 1465 health
      maintenance organization members were identified as depressed high utilizers
      using a 2-stage telephone screening process. Eligibility criteria were met by 410
      patients and 407 agreed to enroll: 218 in the depression management program (DMP)
      practices and 189 in the usual care (UC) group. INTERVENTION: The DMP included
      patient education materials, physician education programs, telephone-based
      treatment coordination, and antidepressant pharmacotherapy initiated and managed 
      by patients' primary care physicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression severity 
      was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) and functional
      status using the Medical Outcomes Study 20-item short form (SF-20) subscales.
      Outpatient visit and hospitalization rates were measured using the health plan's 
      encounter data. RESULTS: Based on an intent-to-treat analysis, at least 3
      antidepressant prescriptions were filled in the first 6 months by 151 (69.3%) of 
      218 of DMP patients vs 35 (18.5%) of 189 in UC (P < .001). Improvements in Ham-D 
      scores were significantly greater in the intervention group at 6 weeks (P = .04),
      3 months (P = .02), 6 months (P < .001), and 12 months (P < .001). At 12 months, 
      DMP intervention patients were more improved than UC patients on the mental
      health, social functioning, and general health perceptions scales of the SF-20 (P
      < .05 for all). CONCLUSION: In depressed high utilizers not already in active
      treatment, a systematic primary care-based treatment program can substantially
      increase adequate antidepressant treatment, decrease depression severity, and
      improve general health status compared with usual care.

      fertilization is as effective and well tolerated as intramuscular menotropin
      treatment. Repronex SC, IVF Study Group.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of Repronex SC as compared with
      Repronex IM and Pergonal IM in patients undergoing IVF. DESIGN: Open-label,
      randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study. SETTING: Fifteen academic and
      private fertility clinics with IVF experience. PATIENT(S): Premenopausal women
      with regular ovulatory menstrual cycles undergoing IVF for infertility
      attributable to tubal factors, endometriosis (stage I or II), or unknown factors.
      INTERVENTION(S): Down-regulation with leuprolide acetate followed by up to 12
      days of treatments with gonadotropins, hCG administration, oocyte retrieval, and 
      embryo transplant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Mean number of oocytes retrieved,
      chemical, clinical, and continuing pregnancies, incidence of oocyte retrieval and
      embryo transfer, and peak serum E2 concentrations. RESULT(S): There were no
      significant differences among the treatment groups except for a higher percentage
      of continuing pregnancies in the Repronex SC group. Gonadotropin therapy was well
      tolerated in all three treatment groups. The Repronex SC group had a
      significantly higher incidence of transient mild/moderate injection site
      reactions during the first few days of therapy. CONCLUSION(S): Repronex SC is
      comparable in therapeutic effectiveness and safety to Repronex IM and Pergonal IM
      in patients undergoing IVF and provides an alternative route of injection for
      self-administration of gonadotropin.

TI  - Effect of lung-volume-reduction surgery in patients with severe emphysema.
PG  - 239-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many patients with severe emphysema have undergone
      lung-volume-reduction surgery, the benefits are uncertain. We conducted a
      randomized, controlled trial of the surgery in patients with emphysema. Patients 
      with isolated bullae were excluded because such patients are known to improve
      after bullectomy. METHODS: Potentially eligible patients were given intensive
      medical treatment and completed a smoking-cessation program and a six-week
      outpatient rehabilitation program before random assignment to surgery or
      continued medical treatment. After 15 patients had been randomized, the entry
      criteria were modified to exclude patients with a carbon monoxide gas-transfer
      value less than 30 percent of the predicted value or a shuttle-walking distance
      of less than 150 m, because of the deaths of 5 such patients (3 treated
      surgically and 2 treated medically). RESULTS: Of the 174 subjects who were
      initially assessed, 24 were randomly assigned to continued medical treatment and 
      24 to surgery. At base line in both groups, the median forced expiratory volume
      in one second (FEV1) was 0.75 liter, and the median shuttle-walking distance was 
      215 m. Five patients in the surgical group (21 percent) and three patients in the
      medical group (12 percent) died (P=0.43). After six months, the median FEV1 had
      increased by 70 ml in the surgical group and decreased by 80 ml in the medical
      group (P=0.02). The median shuttle-walking distance increased by 50 m in the
      surgical group and decreased by 20 m in the medical group (P=0.02). There were
      similar changes on a quality-of-life scale and similar changes at 12 months of
      follow-up. Five of the 19 surviving patients in the surgical group had no benefit
      from the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with severe emphysema,
      lung-volume-reduction surgery can improve FEV1, walking distance, and quality of 
      life. Whether it reduces mortality is uncertain.

TI  - Randomised double blind trial of oral versus intravenous flecainide for the
      cardioversion of acute atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 37-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether an oral loading dose of flecainide is as safe
      and effective as intravenous flecainide for the cardioversion of acute atrial
      fibrillation. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double blind, double placebo
      study. SETTING: Cardiac care unit of a large district general hospital in the UK.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: 79 patients presenting with symptomatic acute atrial
      fibrillation: patients were given either intravenous flecainide (n = 39) or a
      solution of oral flecainide (n = 40), with appropriate placebos. All patients
      were heparinised during the study. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Safety; mean time to
      cardioversion; proportion of patients restored to sinus rhythm at two hours and
      eight hours after treatment. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: There
      were no differences in baseline characteristics between the oral and intravenous 
      groups. Both forms of flecainide were well tolerated, with no adverse clinical
      events during the study. The mean time to cardioversion was 110 minutes in the
      oral group and 52 minutes in the intravenous group (p = 0.002). Two hours after
      treatment, 27 of the 40 patients in the oral group (68%) and 25 of the 39 in the 
      intravenous group (64%) had reverted to sinus rhythm (p = 0.74). Eight hours
      after treatment, 30 patients in the oral group (75%) and 28 in the intravenous
      group (72%) had reverted to sinus rhythm (p = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous
      flecainide restored sinus rhythm more rapidly than oral flecainide, but at two
      hours and eight hours after treatment there was no difference in the proportion
      of patients cardioverted by the two approaches. These results suggest a role for 
      oral loading doses of flecainide in the treatment of acute or symptomatic
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

TI  - Short-course empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with pulmonary infiltrates
      in the intensive care unit. A proposed solution for indiscriminate antibiotic
      prescription.
PG  - 505-11
AB  - Inappropriate antibiotic use for pulmonary infiltrates is common in the intensive
      care unit (ICU). We sought to devise an approach that would minimize unnecessary 
      antibiotic use, recognizing that a gold standard for the diagnosis of nosocomial 
      pneumonia does not exist. In a randomized trial, clinical pulmonary infection
      score (CPIS) (Pugin, J., R. Auckenthaler, N. Mili, J. P. Janssens, R. D. Lew, and
      P. M. Suter. Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia by bacteriologic
      analysis of bronchoscopic and nonbronchoscopic "blind" bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991;143: 1121-1129) was used as operational
      criteria for decision-making regarding antibiotic therapy. Patients with CPIS </=
      6 (implying low likelihood of pneumonia) were randomized to receive either
      standard therapy (choice and duration of antibiotics at the discretion of
      physicians) or ciprofloxacin monotherapy with reevaluation at 3 d; ciprofloxacin 
      was discontinued if CPIS remained </= 6 at 3 d. Antibiotics were continued beyond
      3 d in 90% (38 of 42) of the patients in the standard as therapy compared with
      28% (11 of 39) in the experimental therapy group (p = 0.0001). In patients in
      whom CPIS remained </= 6 at the 3 d evaluation point, antibiotics were still
      continued in 96% (24 of 25) in the standard therapy group but in 0% (0 of 25) of 
      the patients in the experimental therapy group (p = 0.0001). Mortality and length
      of ICU stay did not differ despite a shorter duration (p = 0.0001) and lower cost
      (p = 0.003) of antimicrobial therapy in the experimental as compared with the
      standard therapy arm. Antimicrobial resistance, or superinfections, or both,
      developed in 15% (5 of 37) of the patients in the experimental versus 35% (14 of 
      37) of the patients in the standard therapy group (p = 0.017). Thus,
      overtreatment with antibiotics is widely prevalent, but unnecessary in most
      patients with pulmonary infiltrates in the ICU. The operational criteria used,
      regardless of the precise definition of pneumonia, accurately identified patients
      with pulmonary infiltrates for whom monotherapy with a short course of
      antibiotics was appropriate. Such an approach led to significantly lower
      antimicrobial therapy costs, antimicrobial resistance, and superinfections
      without adversely affecting the length of stay or mortality.

      fibrillation: a comparative, placebo controlled study.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the safety and efficacy of amiodarone and
      sotalol in the treatment of patients with recurrent symptomatic atrial
      fibrillation. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, single blind, placebo controlled
      study. SETTING: Tertiary cardiac referral centre. PATIENTS: 186 consecutive
      patients (97 men, 89 women; mean (SD) age, 63 (10) years) with recurrent,
      symptomatic atrial fibrillation. INTERVENTIONS: 65 patients were randomised to
      amiodarone, 61 to sotalol, and 60 to placebo. Patients receiving amiodarone were 
      maintained at a dose of 200 mg/day after a 30 day loading phase. The sotalol dose
      was 160-480 mg daily, as tolerated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation or side effects. RESULTS: In the amiodarone group, 31 of the 65
      patients developed atrial fibrillation after an average of six months, while 15
      (11 in sinus rhythm and four in atrial fibrillation) experienced significant side
      effects after an average of 16 months. In the sotalol group, relapse to atrial
      fibrillation occurred in 47 of the 61 patients after an average of eight months; 
      three experienced side effects during the titration phase. In the placebo group, 
      53 of the 60 patients developed atrial fibrillation after an average of four
      months (p < 0.001 for amiodarone and sotalol v placebo; p < 0.001 for amiodarone 
      v sotalol). CONCLUSIONS: Both amiodarone and sotalol can be used for the
      maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with symptomatic atrial
      fibrillation. Amiodarone is more effective but causes more side effects.

TI  - Preliminary results of a randomized radiotherapy dose-escalation study comparing 
      70 Gy with 78 Gy for prostate cancer.
PG  - 3904-11
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of radiotherapy dose on prostate cancer patient 
      outcome and biopsy positivity in a phase III trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total
      of 305 stage T1 through T3 patients were randomized to receive 70 Gy or 78 Gy of 
      external-beam radiotherapy between 1993 and 1998. Of these, 301 were assessable; 
      stratification was based on pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level (PSA).
      Dose was prescribed to the isocenter at 2 Gy per fraction. All patients underwent
      planning pelvic computed tomography scan to confirm prostate position. Treatment 
      failure was defined as an increasing PSA on three consecutive follow-up visits or
      the initiation of salvage treatment. Median follow-up was 40 months. RESULTS: One
      hundred fifty patients were randomized to the 70-Gy arm and 151 to the 78-Gy arm.
      The difference in freedom from biochemical and/or disease failure (FFF) rates of 
      69% and 79% for the 70-Gy and 78-Gy groups, respectively, at 5 years was
      marginally significant (log-rank P: =.058). Multiple-covariate Cox proportional
      hazards regression showed that the study randomization was an independent
      correlate of FFF, along with pretreatment PSA, Gleason score, and stage. The
      patients who benefited most from the 8-Gy dose escalation were those with a
      pretreatment PSA of more than 10 ng/mL; 5-year FFF rates were 48% and 75% (P:
      =.011) for the 70-Gy and 78-Gy arms, respectively. There was no difference
      between the arms ( approximately 80% 5-year FFF) when the pretreatment PSA was < 
      or = 10 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: A modest dose increase of 8 Gy using conformal
      radiotherapy resulted in a substantial improvement in prostate cancer FFF rates
      for patients with a pretreatment PSA of more than 10 ng/mL. These findings
      document that local persistence of prostate cancer in intermediate- to high-risk 
      patients is a major problem when doses of 70 Gy or less are used.

TI  - The effects of patient communication skills training on compliance.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between communication skills training for 
      patients and their compliance with recommended treatment. DESIGN: A randomized
      control design was used, with patients nested within physicians. Each physician
      was audiotaped with 6 patients, 2 patients in each of the 3 intervention
      conditions: (1) a trained group (n = 50) received a training booklet in the mail 
      2 to 3 days prior to the scheduled appointment, (2) an informed group (n = 49)
      received a brief written summary of the major points contained in the training
      booklet while in the waiting room prior to the scheduled appointment, and (3) an 
      untrained group (n = 51) did not receive any form of communication skills
      intervention. SETTING: Participants included physicians and patients from 9
      different primary care, family practice locations. Two locations were clinics
      associated with a large, university-based medical school and hospital, while 7
      were private practice offices in the community. PARTICIPANTS: The sample included
      25 family physicians (averaging 11 years postresidency) and 150 patients.
      Patients were randomly selected from appointment records and randomly assigned to
      1 of 3 intervention conditions. INTERVENTION: A training booklet designed to
      instruct patients in information seeking, provision, and verification. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Patients' compliance with medications, behavioral treatment
      (e.g., diet, exercise, smoking cessation), and/or follow-up appointments and
      referrals. RESULTS: Trained patients were more compliant overall than untrained
      or informed patients. Training positively influenced compliance with behavioral
      treatments and follow-up appointments and referrals. CONCLUSION: Training
      patients in communication skills may be a cost-effective way of increasing
      compliance and improving the overall health of patients.

TI  - Effectiveness and costs of omeprazole vs ranitidine for treatment of symptomatic 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease in primary care clinics in West Virginia.
PG  - 624-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and
      medical cost outcomes in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD) receiving omeprazole sodium or ranitidine hydrochloride treatment.
      METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, open-label, medical effectiveness trial
      conducted in 5 university-based family medicine clinics. Two hundred sixty-eight 
      patients with GERD were recruited and randomly assigned to omeprazole sodium, 20 
      mg once daily, or ranitidine hydrochloride, 150 mg twice daily, for up to 6
      months. Main outcome assessments included the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating
      Scale (GSRS) Reflux score, Psychological General Well-Being Index, and
      Short-Form-36 Health Survey administered at baseline and 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. 
      Medical resource use and cost data were collected. RESULTS: More
      omeprazole-treated patients reported improved heartburn resolution at 2 weeks
      (49.0% vs 33.3%; P=.007) and 4 weeks (58.6% vs 35.0%; P<.001) compared with
      ranitidine-treated patients. The GSRS Reflux scores across 3 months showed
      overall differences between omeprazole (mean, 2.67) and ranitidine (mean, 2.95)
      groups (P=.04). Mean total 6-month medical costs were $915 lower ($8371 vs $9286;
      P=.64), and no difference in mean outpatient medical costs ($1198 vs $1158;
      P=.76) were observed in the omeprazole group compared with the ranitidine group. 
      A post hoc secondary analysis showed that, at 12 and 24 weeks, patients treated
      with omeprazole for 8 weeks or more reported greater heartburn resolution (ie, 24
      [43%] of 56 patients at both intervals) than patients treated with ranitidine for
      8 weeks or more (12 [24%] and 13 [26%] of 50 patients, respectively; P=.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Ranitidine and omeprazole were both effective at improving heartburn
      symptoms; however, omeprazole provided greater resolution of heartburn symptoms
      at 2 and 4 weeks. Despite omeprazole's higher acquisition cost, there were no
      significant differences in total or outpatient costs between groups.

TI  - Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockade improves outcomes in diabetic patients
      presenting with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: results
      from the Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management in Patients
      Limited by Unstable Signs and Symptoms (PRISM-PLUS) study.
PG  - 2466-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic patients who present with unstable angina or
      non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction suffer a substantially greater incidence
      of subsequent infarction or death compared with nondiabetic patients. The present
      study was undertaken to examine whether diabetic patients in the Platelet
      Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management in Patients Limited by
      Unstable Signs and Symptoms (PRISM-PLUS) study appeared to benefit from platelet 
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation by
      tirofiban. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of the 1570 PRISM-PLUS patients treated with
      either tirofiban plus heparin (n=773) or heparin alone (n=797), approximately 23%
      in each treatment group were diabetic. A comparison of treatment outcomes in the 
      diabetic subgroup revealed that the combination therapy compared with heparin
      alone was associated with reductions in the incidence of the composite primary
      end point of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or refractory ischemia at 2, 7,
      30, and 180 days (7.7% versus 8.3%, 14. 8% versus 21.8%, 20.1% versus 29.0%, and 
      32.0% versus 39.9%, respectively; P=NS) and in the incidence of MI or death (0.0%
      versus 3.1%, P:=0.03; 1.2% versus 9.3%, P:=0.005; 4.7% versus 15.5%, P:=0. 002;
      and 11.2% versus 19.2%, P:=0.03). Tests for quantitative interaction between
      tirofiban therapy and diabetic status were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The addition
      of tirofiban to heparin and aspirin appears effective in the prevention of major 
      ischemic events, particularly MI or death, in diabetic patients presenting with
      unstable angina and non-ST-elevation MI.

      12-week study with dose enrichment. Physostigmine Study Group.
PG  - 157-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of extended-release physostigmine salicylate, an
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was evaluated in 850 subjects with
      mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) in a multicenter trial. METHODS: Subjects
      initially entered a dose-enrichment phase in which they received 1 week each of
      physostigmine salicylate, 24 mg/d and 30 mg/d, and daily placebo. Among the
      subjects who completed this phase, 35.9% responded to physostigmine treatment,
      whereas 62.4% were considered nonresponders, and 1.6% could not be evaluated
      because of missing data. After a 4-week placebo-washout phase, 176 responder
      subjects were randomized to receive their best dose of physostigmine or placebo
      in a 12-week double-blind phase. Primary efficacy measures included the cognitive
      subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), the Clinician's 
      Interview-Based Impression of Change With Caregiver Input (CIBIC+), and the
      Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC). RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat
      analysis of the double-blind phase, physostigmine-treated subjects scored -2.02
      points better than placebo-treated subjects on the ADAS-Cog (F1,167 = 6.42 [P =
      .01]) and 0.33 points higher on the CIBIC+ (F1,150 = 5.68 [P = .02]). No
      significant improvement was observed on the CGIC or the secondary outcome
      measures. Nausea and vomiting were experienced by 47.0% of all
      physostigmine-treated subjects during the double-blind phase. CONCLUSIONS:
      Physostigmine demonstrated a statistically significant benefit compared with
      placebo on a clinical global rating of change and an objective test of cognitive 
      function. Given the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects, the role of this 
      agent in clinical use remains to be determined.

TI  - Association of noninvasive ventilation with nosocomial infections and survival in
      critically ill patients.
PG  - 2361-7
AB  - CONTEXT: Invasive life-support techniques are a major risk factor for nosocomial 
      infection. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be used to avoid endotracheal
      intubation and may reduce morbidity among patients in intensive care units
      (ICUs). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of NIV is associated with
      decreased risk of nosocomial infections and improved survival in everyday
      clinical practice among patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) or hypercapnic cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE). DESIGN
      AND SETTING: Matched case-control study conducted in the medical ICU of a French 
      university hospital from January 1996 through March 1998. PATIENTS: Fifty
      patients with acute exacerbation of COPD or severe CPE who were treated with NIV 
      for at least 2 hours and 50 patients treated with mechanical ventilation between 
      1993 and 1998 (controls), matched on diagnosis, Simplified Acute Physiology Score
      II, Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, age, and no contraindication to NIV. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of nosocomial infections, antibiotic use, lengths of
      ventilatory support and of ICU stay, ICU mortality, compared between cases and
      controls. RESULTS: Rates of nosocomial infections and of nosocomial pneumonia
      were significantly lower in patients who received NIV than those treated with
      mechanical ventilation (18% vs 60% and 8% vs 22%; P<.001 and P =.04,
      respectively). Similarly, the daily risk of acquiring an infection (19 vs 39
      episodes per 1000 patient-days; P =.05), proportion of patients receiving
      antibiotics for nosocomial infection (8% vs 26%; P =.01), mean (SD) duration of
      ventilation (6 [6] vs 10 [12] days; P =.01), mean (SD) length of ICU stay (9 [7] 
      vs 15 [14] days; P =.02), and crude mortality (4% vs 26%; P =.002) were all lower
      among patients who received NIV than those treated with mechanical ventilation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of NIV instead of mechanical ventilation is associated with a
      lower risk of nosocomial infections, less antibiotic use, shorter length of ICU
      stay, and lower mortality. JAMA. 2000;284:2361-2367.

TI  - Oral bacteriotherapy as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic pouchitis:
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 305-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal
      pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Most patients have relapsing
      disease, and no maintenance treatment study has been performed. We evaluated the 
      efficacy of a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) containing 5 x 10(11) per gram of
      viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacilli, 3 strains of
      bifidobacteria, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus
      compared with placebo in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis. METHODS: 
      Forty patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were randomized to receive
      either VSL#3, 6 g/day, or an identical placebo for 9 months. Patients were
      assessed clinically every month and endoscopically and histologically every 2
      months or in the case of a relapse. Fecal samples were collected for stool
      culture before and after antibiotic treatment and each month during maintenance
      treatment. RESULTS: Three patients (15%) in the VSL#3 group had relapses within
      the 9-month follow-up period, compared with 20 (100%) in the placebo group (P <
      0.001). Fecal concentration of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and S. thermophilus 
      increased significantly from baseline levels only in the VSL#3-treated group (P <
      0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oral administration of this new
      probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis.

TI  - Pilot study of a home-based asthma health education program.
PG  - 93-102
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Caring for a child with asthma can affect the parent's coping and
      well-being and coping strategies. This study examined the influence of a
      home-based asthma health education program on parental coping and quality of
      life. DESIGN: Randomized controlled non-blinded clinical trial. SETTING: Northern
      community pediatrician's office. PATIENTS: Families whose children, under the age
      of 11, had chronic stable asthma, and who presented to the pediatrician's office 
      for continuing care; those with an acute exacerbation of asthma were excluded.
      INTERVENTIONS: Families were randomly assigned to receive either a single
      two-hour, standardized home-based asthma health education session or a booklet
      representing conventional care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One and three-months
      following the intervention, assessments were obtained for coping measured by
      Hymovich's Parent Perception Inventory (PPI), quality of life measured by the
      Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) and change in
      asthma measured by the Caregiver Perception of Change (CPC) survey. RESULTS:
      Forty families were recruited and randomized; baseline characteristics were
      similar between groups. At the final follow-up, reduction in parental need for
      asthma information (p = 0.04), reduction in parental concerns (p = 0.02) and
      increased use of coping strategies (p = 0.04) were observed in the home-based
      care group. Improvement was noted in the parent's perception of their child's
      asthma in the home-based asthma education group (p = 0.01). Quality of life as
      measured by the PACQLQ remained unchanged over the intervention period (p >
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the use of a one-time, flexible,
      home-based intervention to assist families caring for children with asthma should
      be considered and appears effective.

TI  - Epidural analgesia for cephalic version: a randomized trial.
PG  - 648-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if epidural analgesia improves the success rate of
      external cephalic version. METHODS: Women with singleton fetuses in breech or
      transverse presentation of at least 37 weeks' gestation were offered enrollment
      in a randomized trial. Inclusion criteria included maternal age of 18 years or
      older, nonvertex presentation confirmed by ultrasound, intact membranes, reactive
      fetal nonstress test, and estimated fetal weight (EFW) between 2000 and 4000 g.
      Women in the epidural group had lumbar epidural catheters inserted, through which
      2% lidocaine and 100 microg of fentanyl were infused. External cephalic version
      attempts were done with ultrasound guidance in a standard fashion for both
      groups. The primary outcome variable was the successful version of the fetus to a
      cephalic presentation. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant
      differences between groups in gestation at time of procedure, placental location,
      fetal lie, gravity, parity, EFW, or amniotic fluid index. External cephalic
      version was successful in 32 of 54 women (59%) with epidural anesthesia compared 
      with 18 of 54 (33%) with no anesthesia (relative risk [RR] 1.8, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 1.2, 2.8, P <.05). Vaginal delivery occurred in 29 of 54 women
      (54%) in the epidural group and 16 of 54 women (30%) in the control group (RR
      1.9, 95% CI 1.2, 2.9, P <.05). CONCLUSION: Epidural analgesia increased the
      success rate of external cephalic version and the likelihood of subsequent
      vaginal delivery.

TI  - Early use of non-invasive ventilation for acute exacerbations of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease on general respiratory wards: a multicentre
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1931-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Within the intensive-care unit, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can
      prevent the need for intubation and the mortality associated with severe episodes
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to
      find whether the introduction of NIV, early after the admission on a general
      respiratory ward, was effective at reducing the need for intubation and the
      mortality associated with acute exacerbations of COPD. METHODS: We did a
      prospective multicentre randomised controlled study comparing NIV with standard
      therapy in patients with mild to moderate acidosis. NIV was administered on the
      ward with a simple non-invasive ventilator and a standardised predefined
      protocol. Patients were recruited from 14 UK hospitals over 22 months. FINDINGS: 
      236 patients were recruited, 118 received standard therapy alone and 118
      additional NIV. The two groups had similar characteristics at enrolment. The use 
      of NIV significantly reduced the need for intubation as defined by the failure
      criteria. 32/118 (27%) of the standard group failed compared with 18/118 (15%) of
      the NIV group (p=0.02). In-hospital mortality was also reduced by NIV, 24/118
      (20%) died in the standard group compared with 12/118 (10%) in the NIV group
      (p=0.05). In both groups pH, PaCO2, and respiratory rate improved at 4 h
      (p<0.01). However, NIV led to a more rapid improvement in pH in the first hour
      (p=0.02) and a greater fall in respiratory rate at 4 h (p=0.035). The duration of
      breathlessness was also reduced by NIV (p=0.025). INTERPRETATION: The early use
      of NIV for mildly and moderately acidotic patients with COPD in the general ward 
      setting leads to more rapid improvement of physiological variables, a reduction
      in the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (with objective criteria), and a 
      reduction in in-hospital mortality.

TI  - Indomethacin for preterm labor: a randomized comparison of vaginal and
      rectal-oral routes.
PG  - 482-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of intravaginal and intrarectal plus oral
      indomethacin for the treatment of preterm labor. METHODS: Between December 1996
      and November 1998, 46 eligible gravidas admitted with singleton pregnancies and
      idiopathic preterm labor before 33 gestational weeks were randomized to receive
      200 mg of intravaginal or intrarectal plus oral indomethacin. RESULTS:
      Twenty-three subjects were allocated to each study group. The interval from
      initiation of treatment to delivery was significantly longer in the intravaginal 
      indomethacin group (26.5 +/- 5.7 versus 12.6 +/- 3.7 days; P =.007). Delivery was
      delayed by more than 7 days in 18 of 23 subjects (78%) in the intravaginal
      indomethacin group compared with ten (43%) in the intrarectal plus oral
      indomethacin group (P =.03). Birth weights were significantly higher (2306 +/-
      436 versus 1862 +/- 232 g; P =.002) and hospitalization in a neonatal intensive
      care unit (NICU) (3.1 +/- 0.8 versus 9.3 +/- 3. 7 days; P =.001) and mechanical
      ventilation (1.4 +/- 0.2 versus 5.3 +/- 1.6 days; P =.001) were significantly
      shorter in the intravaginal indomethacin group. CONCLUSION: Intravaginal
      indomethacin is more effective than intrarectal plus oral application in delaying
      preterm labor and is associated with higher birth weights, shorter NICU stays,
      and shorter intervals of mechanical ventilation.

TI  - Comparison of wet combing with malathion for treatment of head lice in the UK: a 
      pragmatic randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concern about the effectiveness and toxicity of insecticide lotions
      has led to promotion of mechanical methods to remove head lice. We compared the
      effectiveness of "bug-busting" (wet combing with a fine-toothed comb) and
      malathion lotion. METHODS: We screened 4037 schoolchildren in two counties in
      Wales, UK (intermediate resistance to malathion). Of 167 found to have head lice,
      81 (aged 3-14 years) were eligible to participate in a randomised controlled
      trial that compared mechanical removal of lice by a commercial kit every 3-4 days
      for 2 weeks with two applications of 0.5% malathion lotion 7 days apart; parents 
      carried out both treatments. The outcome measure was the presence of live lice 7 
      days after the end of treatment. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS:
      74 children completed the study and 72 were included in the analysis. The cure
      rate was 38% (12 of 32) for bug-busting and 78% (31 of 40) for malathion.
      Children assigned bug-busting were 2.8 (95% CI 1.5-5.2) times more likely than
      those assigned malathion to have lice at the end of treatment (p=0.0006).
      INTERPRETATION: Malathion lotion was twice as effective as bug-busting, even in
      an area with intermediate resistance. Policies advocating bug-busting as
      first-line treatment for head lice in the general population are inappropriate.
      Assessment of the outcome of treatment 1-2 weeks after completion is essential
      for successful management. Only about 50% of participants complied fully with
      treatment, so future trials should be pragmatic in design, avoid false
      incentives, and study representative samples of children.

TI  - Less hypoglycemia with insulin glargine in intensive insulin therapy for type 1
      diabetes. U.S. Study Group of Insulin Glargine in Type 1 Diabetes.
PG  - 639-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin glargine (21A-Gly-30Ba-L-Arg-30Bb-L-Arg-human insulin) is a
      biosynthetic insulin analog with a prolonged duration of action compared with NPH
      human insulin. This study compared insulin glargine with NPH human insulin in
      subjects with type 1 diabetes who had been previously treated with multiple daily
      injections of NPH insulin and regular insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 
      study was a multicenter randomized parallel-group study in which subjects were
      randomized to receive premeal regular insulin and either insulin glargine (at
      bedtime) or NPH insulin (at bedtime for patients on once-daily therapy and at
      bedtime and in the morning for patients on twice-daily therapy) for up to 28
      weeks. Dose titration of both basal insulins was based on capillary fasting whole
      blood glucose (FBG) levels; the goal was a premeal blood glucose concentration of
      4.4-6.7 mmol/l. RESULTS: A total of 534 well-controlled type 1 diabetic subjects 
      (mean GHb 7.7%, mean fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 11.8 mmo/l) were treated. A
      small decrease in GHb levels was noted with both insulin glargine (-0.16%) and
      NPH insulin (-0.21%; P > 0.05). Significant reductions in median FPG levels from 
      baseline (-1.67 vs. -0.33 mmol/l with NPH insulin, P = 0.0145) and a trend for a 
      reduction in capillary FBG levels were achieved with insulin glargine. After the 
      1-month titration phase, significantly fewer subjects receiving insulin glargine 
      experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia (39.9 vs. 49.2%, P = 0.0219) or nocturnal
      hypoglycemia (18.2 vs. 27.1%, P = 0.0116) with a blood glucose level <2.0 mmol/l 
      compared with subjects receiving NPH insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Lower FPG levels with 
      fewer episodes of hypoglycemia were achieved with insulin glargine compared with 
      once- or twice-daily NPH insulin as part of a basal-bolus regimen in patients
      with type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Effects of pravastatin on left ventricular mass in patients with hyperlipidemia
      and essential hypertension.
PG  - 514-8
AB  - Left ventricular (LV) mass is a powerful predictor for future cardiovascular
      events. Epidemiologic studies have shown that hyperlipidemia is associated with
      higher LV mass. The effects of statin therapy for hyperlipidemia on LV mass have 
      not been studied. To determine the effects of statin therapy on LV mass, we
      prospectively studied 3 groups of age and body surface area-matched patients:
      group 1 (n = 20), patients with systemic hypertension and hyperlipidemia treated 
      with pravastatin plus anti-hypertensive drugs; group 2 (n = 20), patients with
      hypertension and hyperlipidemia treated with hypertensive agents and diet control
      alone; and group 3 (n = 20), hypertensive patients with normolipidemia treated
      with antihypertensive agents. A group of controls without hypertension or
      hyperlipidemia was used for comparison. Echocardiograms were recorded at baseline
      and after 6-month therapy. All hypertensive groups showed significant decreases
      in LV mass index after treatment. Group 1 had the greatest decrease in LV mass
      and it was significantly higher than in groups 2 and 3. Multivariate analysis
      revealed that regression of LV mass was significantly correlated only with the
      use of statins and sex (p = 0.005 and 0.01, respectively, R(2) = 0.47). Linear
      regression analysis in group 1 showed a significant correlation between changes
      in arterial compliance and LV mass regression (r = 0.57, p = 0.01). Thus, the
      addition of a statin may have an additional effect on reducing LV mass,
      independent of lipid-lowering effects.

TI  - Comparison of pharmacokinetics and systemic effects of inhaled fluticasone
      propionate in patients with asthma and healthy volunteers: a randomised crossover
      study.
PG  - 556-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids are currently the cornerstone of asthma
      treatment. Some studies of high-dose fluticasone propionate in patients with no
      or mild asthma have, however, suggested substantial systemic absorption. We
      investigated the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate in patients with
      asthma receiving appropriate doses for severity. METHODS: We did a double-blind, 
      randomised, crossover study in 11 patients with asthma and 13 matched healthy
      controls (age 20-65 years; asthma patients forced expiratory volume in 1 s <75%
      and stable on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids). Patients received one 1000
      microg intravenous dose or 1000 microg daily for 7 days inhaled (via spacer
      device) fluticasone propionate. In the 12 h after dosing, we monitored plasma
      fluticasone propionate and cortisol concentrations by mass spectrometry and
      competitive immunoassay with use of direct chemiluminescence. Analysis was by
      intention to treat. FINDINGS: After inhalation, geometric mean values were
      significantly lower in the asthma group than in controls for fluticasone
      propionate plasma area under curve (1082 [95% CI 850-1451] vs 2815 pg mL(-1)
      h(-1) [2262-3949], -62% difference [45-72]; p<0.001), maximum concentrations (117
      [91-159] vs 383 pg/mL [302-546], -68% [-50 to -81]; p<0.001), and systemic
      bioavailability (10.1 [7.9-14.0] vs 21.4% [15.4-32.2], -54% [-27 to -70];
      p=0.001). Intravenous-dose clearance, volume of distribution at steady state,
      plasma half-life, and mean residence time, were similar in the two groups. Less
      suppression of plasma cortisol concentrations was seen in the asthma group than
      in controls 4-12 h after inhaled fluticasone propionate. INTERPRETATION: Systemic
      availability of fluticasone propionate is substantially less in patients with
      moderate to severe asthma than in healthy controls. Inhaled corticosteroids that 
      are absorbed through the lungs need to be assessed in patients who are receiving 
      doses appropriate for disease severity, and not in normal volunteers.

TI  - Is nebulized aerosol treatment necessary in the pediatric emergency department?
PG  - 1309-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants and small children admitted to the pediatric emergency
      department (PED) with acute wheezing episodes (AWE) are currently treated with
      nebulized wet aerosol (NWA). OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of MDI with
      Nebuchamber (Astra AB; Lund, Sweden), a nonelectrostatic spacer device (NESD), as
      compared to NWA in the treatment of an unselected population of babies and small 
      children with AWE. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
      Forty-two children referred to the PED (median age +/- SD, 16 +/- 15 months) with
      AWE received either placebo MDI through a NESD (four puffs) and salbutamol 0.5 mL
      (2.5 mg) as a NWA (group I, n = 19), or salbutamol MDI and 0.5 mL of saline
      solution administered in the same manner as above (group II, n = 23). This
      treatment was repeated three times every 20 min. RESULTS: The respiratory rates
      (RRs) at baseline were as follows: group I, 45 +/- 11.2 breaths/min; and group
      II, 52.3 +/- 11.3 breaths/min (p = not significant [NS]). After the first,
      second, and third interventions, the percent fall from baseline of the RR were as
      follows: group I, 8.9, 13.1, and 17.9%, respectively; group II, 8. 6, 14.6, and
      18.6%, respectively. There was no significant difference at any time in the
      results between the two groups. The clinical scores (CSs) at baseline were as
      follows: group I, 6.6 +/- 1.3; group II, 6.8 +/- 1.49 (p = NS). After the first, 
      second, and third interventions, the percent fall from baseline of the CS were as
      follows: group I, 9.1, 17.9, and 23.2%, respectively; group II, 8. 6, 18.9, and
      24.7%, respectively. These results, also, did not differ significantly at any
      time between the two groups. Hospitalization rate and side effects did not differ
      between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that even in the group of
      unselected very young children (mean age < 2 years) with AWE, the use of MDI with
      NESD is at least as effective as the use of NWA. As opposed to data from an adult
      population, no plateau was reached in the dose-response curve using the above
      doses over time.

TI  - Effect of decreasing afferent vagal activity with ondansetron on symptoms of
      bulimia nervosa: a randomised, double-blind trial.
PG  - 792-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence have led us to postulate that afferent
      vagal hyperactivity could be an important factor in the pathophysiology of the
      eating disorder bulimia nervosa. Ondansetron is a peripherally active antagonist 
      of the serotonin receptor 5-HT3, and is marketed for prevention of
      vagally-mediated emesis caused by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. We investigated
      the effects of ondansetron on bulimic behaviours in patients with severe and
      chronic bulimia nervosa in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
      METHODS: We enrolled patients with severe bulimia nervosa (at least seven coupled
      binge/vomit episodes per week). The patients were otherwise healthy, their weight
      was normal, and they were not receiving medical or psychiatric treatment. During 
      the first week of the study, patients recorded all eating-behaviour events to
      establish a baseline. In the second week, all patients received placebo, but were
      told that they were receiving either placebo or active drug. At the end of this
      single-blind phase, patients were randomly assigned placebo or ondansetron (24 mg
      daily) for a further 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the number of
      binge/vomit episodes per week. Data were analysed by intention to treat.
      FINDINGS: 29 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 completed the
      baseline study, and 26 completed the single-blind placebo week. 12 patients were 
      assigned placebo, and 14 ondansetron; one patient in the ondansetron group
      dropped out owing to accidental injury. During the 4th week of double-blind
      treatment, mean binge/vomit frequencies were 13.2 per week (SD 11.6) in the
      placebo group, versus 6.5 per week (3.9) in the ondansetron group (estimated
      difference 6.8 [95% CI 4.0-9.5]; p<0.0001). The ondansetron group also showed
      significant improvement, compared with the placebo group, in two secondary
      indicators of disease severity. The amount of time spent engaging in bulimic
      behaviours was decreased on average by 7.6 h per week in the ondansetron group,
      compared with 2.3 h in the placebo group (estimated difference 5.1 [0.6-9.7]).
      Similarly, the number of normal meals and snacks increased on average by 4.3
      normal eating episodes without vomiting per week in the ondansetron group,
      compared with 0.2 in the placebo group (estimated difference 4.1 [1.0-7.2]).
      INTERPRETATION: The decrease in binge-eating and vomiting under ondansetron
      treatment was not achieved by compensatory changes in eating behaviour such as by
      a smaller number of binges of longer duration, or by not eating, or by
      binge-eating without vomiting. Instead, our findings indicate a normalisation of 
      the physiological mechanism(s) controlling meal termination and satiation. Since 
      meal termination and satiety are mainly vagally mediated functions, since
      binge-eating and vomiting produce intense stimulation of vagal afferent fibres,
      and since ondansetron and other 5-HT3 antagonists decrease afferent vagal
      activity, the symptom improvement may result from a pharmacological correction of
      abnormal vagal neurotransmission.

TI  - Venlafaxine versus fluvoxamine in the treatment of delusional depression: a pilot
      double-blind controlled study.
PG  - 26-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported the efficacy of selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors as monotherapy in the treatment of delusional depression. The
      clinical efficacy of venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake blocker,
      has been demonstrated in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe
      depression, but, to date, no evidence is available about its use in depressed
      patients with psychotic features. METHOD: Under double-blind conditions, 28
      hospitalized patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression, severe with
      psychotic features, were randomly assigned to receive fluvoxamine or venlafaxine,
      300 mg/day, for 6 weeks. Severity was evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale
      for Depression (HAM-D) and the Dimensions of Delusional Experience Rating Scale
      (DDERS) administered at baseline and every week thereafter. Side effects were
      also recorded. Clinical response was defined as a reduction of the scores in the 
      21-item HAM-D to 8 or below and in the DDERS to 0. RESULTS: At study completion, 
      the response rates were 78.6% (N = 11) and 58.3% (N = 7) for fluvoxamine and
      venlafaxine, respectively. No significant difference was found between drugs
      (Fisher exact test, p = .40). Analysis of covariance on HAM-D scores did not
      reveal a significantly different decrease of depressive symptomatology between
      the 2 treatment groups (p = .14). Treatment response appeared to be unrelated to 
      the demographic and clinical characteristics recorded. The overall safety profile
      of both fluvoxamine and venlafaxine was favorable. CONCLUSION: The results of
      this pilot double-blind trial show that fluvoxamine is useful in the treatment of
      delusional depression and suggest that venlafaxine may also be an effective
      compound in the treatment of this disorder. The latter finding, although
      promising, warrants further replication in a larger sample of patients.

TI  - A multicenter randomized controlled trial of remacemide hydrochloride as
      monotherapy for PD. Parkinson Study Group.
PG  - 1583-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence suggests that manipulation of the glutamatergic 
      system may provide an alternative strategy for therapeutic intervention in PD.
      Remacemide hydrochloride is a low affinity NMDA channel blocker that might
      improve parkinsonian symptoms by modulating glutamatergic overactivity in the
      basal ganglia or slow worsening by decreasing excitotoxicity. METHODS: The
      authors performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, dose-ranging study of remacemide in patients with early PD who
      were not yet receiving levodopa or dopamine agonists. The primary objective was
      to assess the short-term tolerability and safety of three dosage levels of
      remacemide. Two hundred patients were randomized to receive either remacemide 150
      mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg, or matching placebo daily for 5 weeks. RESULTS:
      Significantly fewer patients receiving remacemide 600 mg daily were able to
      tolerate 5 weeks of their assigned treatment on a BID schedule compared with
      patients receiving placebo (64% versus 94%, p = 0.0002). Most patients who
      experienced intolerable side effects on the BID schedule, however, could tolerate
      the same daily dosage on a QID schedule. The most common adverse events were
      dizziness and nausea. There were no serious adverse events or clinically
      significant treatment-related changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or
      electrocardiograms. There was no evidence of improvement in PD signs or symptoms 
      associated with remacemide monotherapy. CONCLUSION: Remacemide was generally well
      tolerated and safe in this 5-week trial. There was no evidence for a symptomatic 
      effect of remacemide monotherapy in patients with early PD. Based on its
      favorable safety profile and several animal studies, further studies of
      remacemide are warranted as symptomatic therapy in levodopa-treated patients and 
      as a neuroprotective agent.

TI  - Clips versus suture technique: is there a difference?
PG  - 1403-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is one of the most common
      procedures performed today, and wound complications are a major source of
      morbidity and cost. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any difference in
      wound outcome (including cost in a Canadian context) between a subcuticular
      suture technique and skin stapling technique for closure of sternal and leg
      incisions in CABG patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two
      patients undergoing CABG were prospectively, randomly placed to have their
      sternal and leg incisions closed with either a subcuticular suture technique or
      with a skin clip. Data were obtained through chart review, in-hospital
      assessments and follow-up visits. Nonblinded assessments were made regarding
      wound leakage, inflammation, infection, necrosis, swelling, dehiscence and
      cosmesis. Each of the parameters was graded on a scale from 1 to 4. The cost was 
      evaluated in Canadian dollars. RESULTS: There were trends toward increased rates 
      of in-hospital sternal (P=0.09) and leg (P=0.17) incision inflammation when the
      wounds were closed with skin clips. There was a significantly greater (P=0.05)
      rate of sternal wound infection with clips, as well as a tendency (P=0.15) toward
      a greater rate of mediastinitis at follow-up assessment. Cosmetic outcome was
      similar for both groups. The cost incurred was significantly greater when skin
      clips were used for closure. There was a greater than threefold difference, which
      translates to a greater than $10,000 difference over one year. CONCLUSIONS:
      Closure with a subcuticular technique achieves better outcomes than the use of
      skin clips. When factoring in the increased cost incurred by using clips, as well
      as other intangible factors such as surgical skill acquisition, subcuticular
      suture closure appears to be a favourable method of wound closure in CABG
      patients compared with the use of skin stapling techniques.

TI  - The effect of nondirective questioning on women's decisions whether to undergo
      bone density screening: an experimental study.
PG  - 181-91
AB  - This study investigated the effects of nondirective counseling on health
      screening decisions. Ninety women (mean age = 51 years) received information
      about bone density screening and osteoporosis. They were then randomly allocated 
      to 1 of 4 groups and were encouraged to focus on positive issues about bone
      density screening (positive group), on negative issues (negative group), on both 
      positive and negative issues (all-focusing group), or on issues relating to the
      common cold (control group). Women were asked to rate how likely they would be to
      opt for bone density screening if they saw it available. After being informed
      that they could have bone density screening, actual uptake was assessed. It was
      found that the issues on which individuals focused significantly influenced their
      rate likelihood of opting for the scan. Rated likelihood of testing was
      significantly associated with whether individuals actually did opt for testing
      when it was subsequently offered to them.

TI  - Bronchoprotection with a leukotriene receptor antagonist in asthmatic preschool
      children.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - We hypothesized that a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) could provide
      bronchoprotection against the cold, dry air-induced response in asthmatic
      preschool children. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
      study, we examined the effect of the specific LTRA montelukast at 5 mg/d for 2 d 
      on the bronchoconstriction induced by hyperventilation of cold, dry air in 13
      asthmatic children 3 to 5 yr old. The bronchoconstriction was measured as the
      specific airway resistance (sRaw) in a whole-body plethysmograph before and 4 min
      after challenge with cold, dry air. The repeatability of the bronchoprotection
      was examined by repeating the placebo-controlled study in six of the 13 children.
      sRaw increased by an average of 46% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30 to 63%)
      after placebo treatment and 17% (95% CI: 3 to 31%) after montelukast (p < 0.01). 
      Eight of the children were receiving regular treatment with budesonide delivered 
      by an inhaler with a spacer in a mean daily dose of 350 microg, but the
      bronchoprotection provided by montelukast was independent of concurrent steroid
      treatment. There was no convincing evidence of failure to respond, and the
      protective effect of montelukast was consistent upon repeated testing (p = 0.
      02). We conclude that the LTRA montelukast provided clinically significant
      bronchoprotection against the effect of hyperventilation of cold dry air in
      asthmatic children 3 to 5 yr old. The bronchoprotection appeared to be
      homogeneous among the children, and seemed independent of steroid treatment. This
      suggests that LTRAs may be of therapeutic use in limiting clinical symptoms of
      asthma in young children.

TI  - First-line therapy for adult patients with acute asthma receiving a multiple-dose
      protocol of ipratropium bromide plus albuterol in the emergency department.
PG  - 1862-8
AB  - We designed a larger, double-blind, randomized, prospective trial to test our
      hypothesis that patients with acute asthma given combination high dose therapy
      with ipratropium bromide (IB) and beta(2)-agonists will have greater improvement 
      in pulmonary function and fewer hospital admissions than those given
      beta(2)-agonists alone. One hundred eighty patients (mean age +/- SD, 34.3 +/-
      10.5 yr) who presented to an emergency department (ED) for treatment of an
      exacerbation of asthma (baseline FEV(1) < 50% of predicted) were assigned in a
      randomized, double-blind fashion to receive albuterol and placebo (n = 92) or
      albuterol and IB (n = 88). Both drugs were administered through a metered-dose
      inhaler and spacer at 10-min intervals for 3 h (24 puffs or 2,880 microg of
      albuterol and 504 microg of IB each hour). Primary outcome measures were
      improvement in pulmonary function (FEV(1) or peak expiratory flow [PEF]), and
      hospital admission rates. In both groups, pulmonary function improved
      significantly over baseline values (p < 0.01). Subjects who received IB had an
      overall 20.5% (95% CI: 2.6 to 38.4%) (p = 0.02) greater improvement in PEF and a 
      48.1% (95% CI: 19.8 to 76.4%) (p = 0.001) greater improvement in FEV(1) from the 
      control group. At the end of protocol (3 h), 39% (n = 36) of patients in the
      control group and 20% (n = 18) in the IB group were admitted (p = 0.01). The use 
      of high doses of IB reduced the risk of hospital admission 49% (relative risk =
      0.51, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.83). Five (95% CI: 3 to 17) patients would need to be
      treated with high doses of IB to prevent a single admission.
      Kaplan-Meier-estimated curves of the proportion of patients who reached the
      discharge threshold during the 3 h of treatment, showed a significant difference 
      in favor of the IB group (log-rank test = 0.005). A subgroup analysis showed that
      patients most likely to benefit from the addition of high doses of IB were those 
      with more severe obstruction (FEV(1) </= 30% of predicted) and long duration of
      symptoms before the ED presentation (>/= 24 h). On the contrary, previous use of 
      inhaled beta(2)-agonists did not modify the admission rate and the pulmonary
      function response to IB. In conclusion, our data support a substantial
      therapeutic benefit from the addition of IB to albuterol administered in high
      doses through MDI plus spacer, particularly in patients with FEV(1) less than
      30%, and with long duration of symptoms before the ED presentation (>/= 24 h).

PG  - 260-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anterior structural damage to the anal sphincter occurs in up to a
      third of women at first vaginal delivery, and of these a third have new bowel
      symptoms. The standard treatment for such structural damage is anterior
      overlapping anal-sphincter repair. We aimed to assess the long-term results of
      this operation. METHODS: We assessed the long-term results in 55 consecutive
      patients who had had repair a minimum of 5 years (median 77 months [range 60-96])
      previously. Questionnaire and telephone interview assessed current bowel function
      and continence, restriction in activities related to bowel control, and overall
      satisfaction with the results of surgery. 42 of these patients had been continent
      of solid and liquid stool at a median of 15 months after the repair. FINDINGS: We
      were able to contact 47 (86%) of the 55 patients. One of these patients had
      required a proctectomy and end ileostomy for Crohn's disease. Of the remaining 46
      patients, 27 reported improved bowel control without the need for further
      surgery, and 23 rated their symptom improvement as 50% or greater. Seven patients
      had undergone further surgery for incontinence and one patient had not had a
      covering stoma closed. Thus, the long-term functional outcome of the sphincter
      repair alone could be assessed in 38 patients. Of these patients, none was fully 
      continent to both stool and flatus; only four were totally continent to solid and
      liquid stool; six had no faecal urgency; and eight had no passive soiling. Of the
      38 patients, 20 still wore a pad for incontinence and 25 reported lifestyle
      restriction. 14 reported the onset of a new evacuation disorder after sphincter
      repair. 23 of the 46 patients contacted had a successful long-term outcome
      (defined as no further surgery and urge faecal incontinence monthly or less).
      INTERPRETATION: The results of overlapping sphincter repair for obstetric
      anal-sphincter damage seem to deteriorate with time. Preoperative counselling
      should emphasise that although most patients will improve after the procedure,
      continence is rarely perfect, many have residual symptoms, and some may develop
      new evacuation disorders.

TI  - Evaluation of platelet activation in depressed patients with ischemic heart
      disease after paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment.
PG  - 137-40
AB  - This study investigated the effects of antidepressant treatment on platelet
      activation in depressed patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). Plasma levels
      of platelet alpha-granule release products beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) and
      platelet factor 4 (PF4) were measured in 17 depressed patients with IHD who were 
      treated in a 6-week, double-blind trial with either paroxetine (10 patients) or
      nortriptyline (7 patients). Baseline measurements of BTG and PF4 were
      significantly elevated in both drug treatment groups before the initiation of
      antidepressant therapy compared with those of healthy control subjects. In the
      paroxetine group, mean PF4 and BTG levels significantly decreased from these
      elevated baseline values within 1 week of treatment and remained low at 3- and
      6-week measurements. In contrast, the nortriptyline group did not exhibit a
      significant decrease in PF4 or BTG plasma levels after 1, 3, or 6 weeks of
      treatment. Therefore, platelet activation in depressed patients with IHD seems to
      be inhibited by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine. The effect
      of paroxetine on PF4 and BTG plasma levels suggests that it may reduce platelet
      aggregation in vivo and may positively impact IHD-related mortality in this
      population.

TI  - A randomized, prospective evaluation of noninvasive ventilation for acute
      respiratory failure.
PG  - 807-13
AB  - We compared noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), using bilevel
      positive airway pressure, with usual medical care (UMC) in the therapy of
      patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) in a prospective, randomized trial.
      Patients were subgrouped according to the disease leading to ARF (chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], a non-COPD-related pulmonary process,
      neuromuscular disease, and status postextubation), and were then randomized to
      NPPV or UMC. Thirty-two patients were evaluated in the NPPV group and 29 in the
      UMC group. The rate of endotracheal intubation (ETI) was significantly lower in
      the NPPV than in the UMC group (6.38 intubations versus 21.25 intubations per 100
      ICU days, p = 0.002). Mortality rates in the intensive care unit (ICU) were
      similar for the two treatment groups (2.39 deaths versus 4.27 deaths per 100 ICU 
      days, p = 0.21, NPPV versus UMC, respectively). Patients with hypoxemic ARF in
      the NPPV group had a significantly lower ETI rate than those in the UMC group
      (7.46 intubations versus 22.64 intubations per 100 ICU days, p = 0.026); a
      similar trend was noted for patients with hypercapnic ARF (5.41 intubations
      versus 18.52 intubations per 100 ICU days, p = 0.064, NPPV versus UMC,
      respectively). Patients with ARF in the non-COPD category had a lower rate of ETI
      with NPPV than with UMC (8.45 intubations versus 30.30 intubations per 100 ICU
      days, p = 0.01). Although the rate of ETI was lower among COPD patients receiving
      NPPV, this trend did not reach statistical significance (5.26 intubations versus 
      15.63 intubations per 100 ICU days, p = 0.12, NPPV versus UMC, respectively). In 
      conclusion, NPPV with bilevel positive airway pressure reduces the rate of ETI in
      patients with ARF of various etiologies.

TI  - Neuropsychological and clinical correlates of antisaccade task performance in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 866-71
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To elucidate pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in abnormal
      antisaccade task performance in schizophrenia by investigating a possible
      relationship among antisaccade task performance, neuropsychological test results,
      and symptomatology in a group of young patients with recent-onset schizophrenia; 
      to compare the effects of olanzapine and risperidone on antisaccades and
      reflexive saccades. BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia consistently perform 
      worse than controls on the antisaccade task in which the subject is required to
      inhibit a reflexive saccade to a suddenly appearing visual target and look in the
      opposite direction. METHODS: In 37 young (mean age 21 years), medicated patients 
      with recent-onset schizophrenia the authors assessed antisaccades, reflexive
      saccades, neuropsychological test performance, and symptomatology. A subgroup of 
      18 patients was treated with olanzapine, and 15 patients were treated with
      risperidone. Reflexive-saccade and antisaccade task results were compared with
      those obtained in 13 control subjects. RESULTS: The antisaccade error rate was
      significantly higher in the patients than in the control subjects. In the
      patients, poor working memory function was related to increased antisaccade error
      rate. Severity of disorganization symptoms at intake was related to prolonged
      mean latency of the correct antisaccades. Patients on risperidone had a prolonged
      mean latency in the reflexive saccade task compared with patients using
      olanzapine. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal antisaccade task performance is already present
      in early schizophrenia and may reflect working memory dysfunction. In future
      studies, medication effects should be considered in interpreting eye movement
      test results of patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Prospective randomized comparison of single-dose versus hyperfractionated
      total-body irradiation in patients with hematologic malignancies.
PG  - 981-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Fractionated total-body irradiation (HTBI) is considered to induce less 
      toxicity to normal tissues and probably has the same efficacy as single-dose
      total-body irradiation (STBI) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. We decided
      to determine whether this concept can be applied to a large number of patients
      with various hematologic malignancies using two dissimilar fractionation
      schedules. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1986 and October 1994, 160
      patients with various hematologic malignancies were randomized to receive either 
      a 10-Gy dose of STBI or 14.85-Gy dose of HTBI. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven
      patients were assessable. The 8-year overall survival rate and cause-specific
      survival rate in the STBI group was 38% and 63.5%, respectively. Overall survival
      rate and cause-specific survival rate in the HTBI group was 45% and 77%,
      respectively. The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis was similar in both
      groups. However, the incidence of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver was
      significantly higher in the STBI group. In the multivariate analysis with overall
      survival as the end point, the female sex was an independent favorable prognostic
      factor. On the other hand, when cause-specific survival was considered as the end
      point, the multivariate analysis demonstrated that sex and TBI were independent
      prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of HTBI is probably higher than that
      of STBI. Both regimens induce similar toxicity with the exception of VOD of the
      liver, the incidence of which is significantly more pronounced in the STBI group.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy for
      migraine.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy
      (SMT) in the treatment of migraine. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of 6
      months' duration. The trial consisted of 3 stages: 2 months of data collection
      (before treatment), 2 months of treatment, and a further 2 months of data
      collection (after treatment). Comparison of outcomes to the initial baseline
      factors was made at the end of the 6 months for both an SMT group and a control
      group. SETTING: Chiropractic Research Center of Macquarie University.
      PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-seven volunteers between the ages of 10 and 70
      years were recruited through media advertising. The diagnosis of migraine was
      made on the basis of the International Headache Society standard, with a minimum 
      of at least one migraine per month. INTERVENTIONS: Two months of chiropractic SMT
      (diversified technique) at vertebral fixations determined by the practitioner
      (maximum of 16 treatments). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed
      standard headache diaries during the entire trial noting the frequency, intensity
      (visual analogue score), duration, disability, associated symptoms, and use of
      medication for each migraine episode. RESULTS: The average response of the
      treatment group (n = 83) showed statistically significant improvement in migraine
      frequency (P < .005), duration (P < .01), disability (P < .05), and medication
      use (P< .001) when compared with the control group (n = 40). Four persons failed 
      to complete the trial because of a variety of causes, including change in
      residence, a motor vehicle accident, and increased migraine frequency. Expressed 
      in other terms, 22% of participants reported more than a 90% reduction of
      migraines as a consequence of the 2 months of SMT. Approximately 50% more
      participants reported significant improvement in the morbidity of each episode.
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study support previous results showing that some 
      people report significant improvement in migraines after chiropractic SMT. A high
      percentage (>80%) of participants reported stress as a major factor for their
      migraines. It appears probable that chiropractic care has an effect on the
      physical conditions related to stress and that in these people the effects of the
      migraine are reduced.

TI  - Effective prevention of atrial fibrillation by continuous atrial overdrive pacing
      after coronary artery bypass surgery.
PG  - 1411-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a specific
      algorithm with continuous atrial dynamic overdrive pacing to prevent atrial
      fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. BACKGROUND: 
      Atrial fibrillation occurs in 30% to 40% of patients after cardiac surgery with a
      peak incidence on the second day. It still represents a challenge for
      postoperative prevention and treatment and may have medical and cost
      implications. METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients undergoing CABG for severe
      coronary artery disease and in sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic therapy on the
      second postoperative day were randomized to have or not 24 h of atrial pacing
      through temporary epicardial wires using a permanent dynamic overdrive algorithm.
      Holter ECGs recorded the same day in both groups were analyzed to detect AF
      occurrence. RESULTS: No difference was observed in baseline data between the two 
      study groups, particularly for age, male gender, history of AF, ventricular
      function, severity of coronary artery disease, preoperative beta-adrenergic
      blocking agent therapy or P-wave duration. The incidence of AF was significantly 
      lower (p = 0.036) in the paced group (10%) compared with control subjects (27%). 
      Multivariate analysis showed AF incidence to increase with age (p = 0.051) but
      not in patients with pacing (p = 0.078). It decreased with a better left
      ventricular ejection fraction only in conjunction with atrial pacing (p = 0.018).
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that continuous atrial pacing with an algorithm for
      dynamic overdrive reduces significantly incidence of AF the second day after CABG
      surgery, particularly in patients with preserved left ventricular function.

TI  - Quality of life in patients with glioblastoma multiforme participating in a
      randomized study of brachytherapy as a boost treatment.
PG  - 917-26
AB  - OBJECT: Until recently the assessment of outcome in patients treated for glioma
      has emphasized length of survival with the evaluation of quality of life (QOL)
      limited to unidimensional, mostly physical, measures. The authors report the
      multidimensional assessment of QOL as part of a randomized clinical trial of
      brachytherapy as a boost in the initial treatment of patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme. METHODS: A questionnaire previously developed by the senior authors
      and psychometrically validated was completed by patients on randomized entry into
      the study and at follow-up review every 3 months thereafter. The questionnaire
      was presented in a linear-analog self-assessment format. Karnofsky Performance
      Scale (KPS) scores were also recorded on each occasion. No differences were found
      between patients in either arm of the study (conventional radiation therapy
      consisting of 50 Gy in 25 fractions or conventional radiation plus a
      brachytherapy boost of a minimum peripheral tumor dose of 60 Gy) in KPS and QOL
      scores during the 1st year of follow-up review. However, there was a
      statistically significant deterioration in patients' overall KPS scores during
      the 1st year of follow up compared with baseline scores. Of QOL items evaluated, 
      statistically significant deteriorations were found in self care, speech, and
      concentration, and on subscale analyses, cognitive functioning and physical
      experience (symptoms) deteriorated significantly during the 1st year of follow
      up, compared with baseline values. The correlation between QOL and KPS scores was
      low. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies in patients harboring malignant gliomas must
      incorporate measures assessing QOL because traditional measures focusing on
      physical or neurological functioning give an incomplete assessment of the
      patient's experience.

TI  - Metoclopramide for preventing pneumonia in critically ill patients receiving
      enteral tube feeding: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1408-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether metoclopramide prevents nosocomial pneumonia in
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving enteral feeding by a nasogastric
      tube. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: ICU of a
      university hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 305 consecutive patients requiring
      placement of a nasogastric tube for >24 hrs. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were
      randomized to receive either 10 mg of metoclopramide or placebo at 8-hr intervals
      through the nasogastric tube. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 174
      patients received placebo and 131 received metoclopramide. Baseline
      characteristics in the two treatment groups were comparable. Of the 305 patients,
      46 developed nosocomial pneumonia, which was 24 patients (13.7%) in the placebo
      group and 22 (16.8%) in the metoclopramide group (p > .05). Patients in the
      placebo group developed pneumonia earlier than patients receiving metoclopramide 
      (4.46+/-1.72 days [mean +/- SD[rsqb] after ICU admission compared with
      5.95+/-1.78 days; p = .006). Subgroup analysis showed that metoclopramide did not
      reduce the frequency rate of pneumonia in patients with tracheal intubation (19
      [25.3%] of 75 patients receiving metoclopramide vs. 21 [21.2%] of 99 patients
      receiving placebo) or those receiving mechanical ventilation (17 [25.6%] of 58
      patients receiving metoclopramide vs. 20 [29.3%] of 78 patients receiving
      placebo). The mortality rate also did not differ in the two treatments groups
      (56% in the metoclopramide group vs. 53% in the placebo group; p > .05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Although metoclopramide delayed the development of nosocomial
      pneumonia, it did not decrease its frequency rate and had no effect on the
      mortality rate in critically ill patients receiving nasogastric enteral feeding.

TI  - Improving survival without reducing quality of life in small-cell lung cancer
      patients by increasing the dose-intensity of chemotherapy with granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor support: results of a British Medical Research Council 
      Multicenter Randomized Trial. Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party.
PG  - 395-404
AB  - PURPOSE: The treatment of small-cell lung cancer patients with good performance
      status aims to improve survival. Dose-intensification could be a way to achieve
      improved survival but can be limited by neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
      Preliminary, nonrandomized feasibility studies showed that doxorubicin,
      cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (ACE) could be given every 2 (instead of the
      usual 3) weeks with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (lenograstim;
      Chugai-Rh inverted question markone-Poulenc, Tokyo, Japan) support. The present
      multicenter randomized trial was designed to examine whether such
      dose-intensification improves survival while maintaining acceptable toxicity
      levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were randomized to receive six cycles 
      of ACE either every 3 weeks (control [C] group) or every 2 weeks with G-CSF (G
      group). The standard dose-intensity of ACE was increased by 50% in group G.
      RESULTS: Four hundred and three patients (G group: n = 201; C group: n = 202)
      were randomized. The received dose-intensity was 34% higher in the G group than
      in the C group. Complete response rates were 40% for the G group and 28% for the 
      C group (P =.02), and overall rates were 78% for the G group and 79% for the C
      group. Survival was longer in the G group (hazard ratio = 0.80; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.65 to 0.99; P =.04), survival rates for the G and C groups being 47% 
      and 39% at 12 months and 13% and 8% at 24 months, respectively. Metastasis-free
      survival, nonhematologic toxicity, and quality of life were similar in the two
      groups. In the G group, there was less neutropenia but more thrombocytopenia and 
      more frequent blood and platelet transfusions. CONCLUSION: Increasing the
      dose-intensity of ACE with G-CSF support improved survival while maintaining
      acceptable toxicity.

TI  - Zafirlukast improves asthma control in patients receiving high-dose inhaled
      corticosteroids.
PG  - 578-85
AB  - Not all asthma can be adequately controlled, despite the use of high-dose inhaled
      corticosteroids. Because cysteinyl-leukotrienes (Cys-LT) have been implicated in 
      the pathogenesis of asthma, we hypothesized that the leukotriene receptor
      antagonist zafirlukast, in combination with high-doses of inhaled
      corticosteroids, might be efficacious in severe asthma. In a double-blind,
      parallel group study, 368 chronic adult asthmatic patients treated with inhaled
      corticosteroids (1,000 to 4,000 microgram/d), who had a predefined level of
      asthma symptoms during the run in period of the study, were randomly assigned to 
      receive additional treatment with a high dose of zafirlukast (80 mg twice daily) 
      (n = 180) or placebo (n = 188) for 6 wk. Compared with placebo, zafirlukast
      produced a significant improvement over baseline in the primary study endpoint of
      mean morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) (18.7 L/min versus 1.5 L/min, p <
      0.001), as well as in evening PEFR (p < 0.01), FEV(1) (p < 0.05), daytime symptom
      score (p < 0.001), and beta(2)-agonist use (p < 0.001). Furthermore, zafirlukast 
      significantly reduced the risk of an exacerbation of asthma (odds ratio [OR]:
      0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38 to 0.99) and the risk of patients
      requiring a further increase in asthma controller therapy (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2
      to 0.8). In conclusion, in patients taking high-dose inhaled corticosteroids,
      zafirlukast improves pulmonary function and asthma symptoms, and reduces the risk
      of an asthma exacerbation, suggesting that the contribution of leukotrienes to
      asthma symptoms and exacerbations is not adequately controlled by high-dose
      inhaled corticosteroids.

      residual depression.
PG  - 440-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 30% of psychiatric out-patients with major depression
      demonstrate partial remission. AIMS: To explore whether the addition of cognitive
      therapy (CT) had any differential effect on residual symptoms or social
      adjustment. METHOD: Patients with residual symptoms of major depression (n=158)
      were randomised to receive clinical management (CM) alone, or CM plus 18 sessions
      of CT. Subjects' depressive symptoms and social functioning were assessed
      regularly over 16 months. RESULTS: The addition of CT produced statistically
      significant differential effects on: two out of four measures of overall severity
      of depression; specific psychological symptoms (guilt, self-esteem and
      hopelessness); and social functioning (including dependency, interpersonal
      behaviour and friction). CONCLUSIONS: In patients showing only partial response
      to antidepressants, the addition of CT produced modest improvements in social and
      psychological functioning. The implications for research on the mechanisms of
      action of CT are discussed.

TI  - Effects of biatrial pacing in prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation
      after coronary artery bypass surgery.
PG  - 755-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common after coronary artery bypass
      surgery (CABG) and results in prolonged hospitalization. The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the efficacy of biatrial pacing in preventing post-CABG AF 
      compared with single-site atrial pacing. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 132
      patients who had no history of AF and who underwent CABG were randomized to 1 of 
      the following 4 groups: biatrial pacing (BiA), left atrial pacing (LA), right
      atrial pacing (RA), or no pacing (control) in postoperative period. Overdrive
      atrial pacing was performed for 5 days. The incidence of AF was significantly
      reduced in the BiA group (12.5%) compared with the other 3 groups (LA, 36.4%; RA,
      33.3%; control, 41. 9%; P<0.05). The mean length of hospital stay was
      significantly reduced in the BiA group. At baseline, the mean P-wave duration
      (P(dur)) and dispersion (P(dis)) were not prolonged. BiA pacing resulted in the
      most significant percentage of reduction in P(dis) when compared with the LA or
      RA groups (BiA, 42+/-8%; LA, 13+/-6%; RA, 10+/-9%; P<0.05 for BiA versus LA or
      RA). No significant differences existed in mean P(dur) and P(dis) between
      patients who developed AF and those who remained in sinus rhythm at baseline.
      However, only those patients who remained in sinus rhythm had a significant
      reduction in mean P(dur) and P(dis) after pacing therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Biatrial
      overdrive pacing is more effective in preventing post-CABG AF than single-site
      atrial pacing; this therapy also results in a shortened hospital stay. The
      overall reduction in atrial activation time with BiA pacing was reflected in the 
      reduction in P(dis).

TI  - Pneumatic compression hemodynamics in total hip arthroplasty.
PG  - 180-91
AB  - A crossover study was performed to evaluate the effect of several pneumatic
      compression devices and active dorsoplantar flexion in 10 patients who underwent 
      total hip arthroplasty. Using the Acuson 128XP/10 duplex ultrasound unit with a
      5-MHz linear array probe, peak venous velocity and venous volume were assessed
      above and below the greater saphenous vein and common femoral vein junction. A
      computer generated randomization table was used to determine the order of the
      test conditions. The pneumatic compression devices evaluated included two foot
      pumps, one foot and calf pump, one calf pump, and three calf and thigh pumps.
      Statistical analyses included analysis of variance and analysis of variance with 
      covariance between devices and patients. The covariates tested were the baseline 
      measurements and the order in which the devices were tested. Differences between 
      devices relate in part to the frequency and rate of inflation and the location
      and type of compression. Pulsatile calf and foot and calf pneumatic compression
      with a rapid inflation time produced the greatest increase in peak venous
      velocity, whereas compression of the calf and thigh showed the greatest increase 
      in venous volume. Because patient and nursing compliance is essential to the
      success of mechanical prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease, the more simple,
      yet efficacious, devices that are easier to apply and less cumbersome appear to
      have a greater likelihood of success. In the active and alert patient, active
      dorsoplantar flexion should be encouraged.

TI  - A randomised comparison and economic evaluation of laparoscopic-assisted
      hysterectomy and abdominal hysterectomy.
PG  - 1386-91
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety, cost effectiveness and effect on quality of 
      life of laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) compared with total
      abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) in the management of benign gynaecological disease. 
      DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation. SETTING: Three
      hospitals in the West of Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred women scheduled for 
      an abdominal hysterectomy for benign gynaecological disease. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Conversion rate of LAVH to TAH, complication rates, NHS resource use
      and costs, quality of life using EuroQol 5 D visual analogue scale, and
      achievement of milestones. RESULTS: The overall incidence of operative
      complications was 14% in the TAH group and 8% in the LAVH group, with an 8%
      conversion rate. Length of operation was significantly greater in the women
      having LAVH at 81 +/- 30 min vs 47 +/- 16 min (P < 0.001). There was no
      difference in analgesic requirements between the groups although there was a
      significantly shorter hospital stay for those having LAVH. The rate of
      post-surgery recovery, satisfaction with operation and quality of life at four
      weeks post-operative were similar in the two groups of women. LAVH was
      significantly more expensive than TAH and remained more expensive for all but the
      most extreme scenario. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that despite the
      decreased length of hospital stay, LAVH is more expensive than TAH. In addition, 
      recovery following operation and patient satisfaction were not affected by the
      route chosen. It is unlikely that LAVH represents an efficient use of NHS
      resources.

TI  - Protective effects of fluticasone on allergen-induced airway responses and sputum
      inflammatory markers.
PG  - 313-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A direct comparison of the protective effects of single and regular
      doses of inhaled glucocorticoid on allergen-induced asthmatic responses and
      inflammation has not been made. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of pretreatment
      with fluticasone 250 microg 30 min before allergen inhalation and two weeks of
      250 microg twice daily (last dose 24 h before challenge) with single and regular 
      (twice daily) placebo doses on early and late asthmatic responses, induced sputum
      cell counts and measures of eosinophil activation at 7 h and 24 h, and
      methacholine airway responsiveness at 24 h. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten mild
      asthmatic patients were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      crossover study. RESULTS: Regular fluticasone increased the baseline mean
      provocative concentration of methacholine to cause a 20% fall (PC20) in forced
      expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from 2.6 to 6.4 mg/mL (P<0.05) and lowered the
      eosinophil count from 3.1% to 0.4% (P<0.05) compared with regular placebo.
      Neither single nor regular fluticasone had any effect on the early asthmatic
      response. Single fluticasone attenuated the late asthmatic response, the mean +/-
      SEM maximum percentage fall in FEV1 (10.8+/-3.6 compared with single placebo 18. 
      8+/-3.5, P=0.03), the allergen-induced increase of airway responsiveness
      (P<0.05), and the eosinophilia (P<0.005) and activated eosinophils at 7 h
      (P<0.01) but not at 24 h. Regular fluticasone also attenuated the late asthmatic 
      response (11.1+/-2.5) compared with regular placebo (19.6+/-4.5), but this was
      not statistically significant and did not protect against the induced increase in
      airway responsiveness or the sputum eosinophilia. CONCLUSION: Two weeks of
      regular inhaled fluticasone discontinued 24 h before allergen challenge does not 
      offer any additional protection against the early or late asthmatic responses,
      increased airway responsiveness or sputum eosinophilia compared with a single
      dose of 250 microg immediately before allergen challenge, despite increasing
      baseline PC20 and decreasing sputum eosinophilia prechallenge. The significance
      of the protective effect of a single dose of inhaled steroid before an allergen
      inhalation and the duration of the protective effect need further investigation.

TI  - Additive effects of salmeterol and fluticasone or theophylline in COPD.
PG  - 1576-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: ss(2)-Agonists and corticosteroids or theophylline can interact to
      produce beneficial effects on airway function in asthma, but this has not been
      established in COPD. METHODS: Eighty patients with well-controlled COPD were
      randomized to receive 3 months of treatment in one of four treatment groups: (1) 
      salmeterol, 50 microg bid; (2) salmeterol, 50 microg, plus fluticasone
      propionate, 250 microg bid; (3) salmeterol, 50 microg, plus fluticasone
      propionate, 500 microg bid; and (4) salmeterol, 50 microg, plus titrated
      theophylline bid. At each visit, a dose-response curve to inhaled salbutamol was 
      constructed using a total cumulative dose of 800 microg. RESULTS: A gradual
      increase in FEV(1) was observed with each of the four treatments. Maximum
      significant increases in FEV(1) over baseline values that were observed after 3
      months of treatment were as follows: salmeterol, 50 microg bid, 0.163 L (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 0.080 to 0.245 L); salmeterol, 50 microg, plus
      fluticasone propionate, 250 microg bid, 0.188 L (95% CI, 0.089 to 0. 287 L);
      salmeterol, 50 microg, plus fluticasone propionate, 500 microg bid, 0.239 L (95% 
      CI, 0.183 to 0.296 L); and salmeterol, 50 microg, plus titrated theophylline bid,
      0.157 L (95% CI, 0.027 to 0. 288 L). Salbutamol always caused a significant
      dose-dependent increase in FEV(1) (p < 0.001), although the 800-microg dose never
      induced further significant benefit when compared with the 400-microg dose. The
      mean differences between the highest salbutamol FEV(1) after salmeterol, 50
      microg, plus fluticasone propionate, 500 microg bid, and that after salmeterol,
      50 microg, plus titrated theophylline bid or salmeterol, 50 microg bid, were
      statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data show that both
      long-acting ss(2)-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids have a role in COPD. The
      data also show that fluticasone propionate and salmeterol given together are more
      effective than salmeterol alone. Moreover, it suggests that the addition of
      fluticasone propionate to salmeterol allows a greater improvement in lung
      function after salbutamol, although regular salmeterol is able to improve lung
      function in COPD patients without development of a true subsensitivity to its
      bronchodilator effect. In any case, patients must be treated for at least 3
      months before a real improvement in lung function is achieved.

TI  - The effect of weight loss in overweight, lactating women on the growth of their
      infants.
PG  - 449-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The retention of weight gained during pregnancy may contribute to
      obesity. Lactation should promote weight loss, but weight loss is highly variable
      among lactating women. The risks associated with the restriction of energy intake
      during lactation have not been adequately evaluated. The purpose of this study
      was to determine whether weight loss by women during lactation affects the growth
      of their infants. METHODS: We randomly assigned 40 breast-feeding women who were 
      overweight (defined as a body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the 
      square of the height in meters] of 25 to 30) at 4 weeks post partum either to
      restrict their energy intake by 500 kcal per day and to exercise for 45 minutes
      per day for 4 days per week (the diet-and-exercise group) or to maintain their
      usual dietary intake and not exercise more than once per week for 10 weeks (the
      control group). We measured the weight and fat mass of the women and the weight
      and length of the infants before, during, and at the end of the study period.
      RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) energy intake decreased by 544+/-471 kcal per day in
      the diet-and-exercise group. As compared with the control group, the women in the
      diet-and-exercise group lost more weight (4.8+/-1.7 kg vs. 0.8+/-2.3 kg, P<0.001)
      and fat mass (4.0+/-2.0 kg vs. 0.3+/-1.8 kg, P<0.001). The gains in weight and
      length of the infants whose mothers were in the diet-and-exercise group
      (1925+/-500 g and 7.8+/-2.0 cm, respectively) were not significantly different
      from those of the infants whose mothers were in the control group (1861+/-576 g
      and 7.3+/-1.7 cm). CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss of approximately 0.5 kg per week
      between 4 and 14 weeks post partum in overweight women who are exclusively
      breast-feeding does not affect the growth of their infants.

AB  - Remifentanil is a short-acting, esterase-metabolized opioid analgesic. This study
      compared the abuse liability of remifentanil with that of fentanyl and placebo in
      a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Twelve recreational users of opioids
      received increasing doses of remifentanil (0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.0

      "Good Effects") and physiologic variables (blood pressure, O2 saturation, pupil
      diameter) were recorded. For each measure, the differences from baseline were
      reduced to an area under the response curve (AUC) and a peak, and each subject's 
      response to the maximum tolerable dose for each of the two active drug classes
      and mean response to several placebo infusions were entered into a 12 x 3
      analysis of variance. All differences in drug versus placebo effects were
      significant. Although a majority of the peak effects that were measurable within 
      4 minutes after drug infusion reflected greater remifentanil effects, only one,
      High VAS, was statistically significant. In contrast, observations that could
      only be made > or = 5 minutes after drug infusion predominantly indicated
      significantly greater fentanyl peak effects, including High VAS, Liking VAS, Good
      Effects VAS, and Cole/ARCI Abuse Potential. Fentanyl AUCs were generally
      significantly larger than the corresponding remifentanil AUCs. A drug abuser
      seeking longer-lasting drug effects might select fentanyl over remifentanil, but 
      these data do not completely rule out remifentanil abuse by some individuals with
      access to both the drug and the infusion equipment or by those who prefer
      briefer, repeated effects.

TI  - Hemodynamic comparison of twice daily metoprolol tartrate with once daily
      metoprolol succinate in congestive heart failure.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the hemodynamic effects of twice daily metoprolol tartrate
      (MT) and once daily metoprolol succinate (MS) in congestive heart failure
      patients. BACKGROUND: Adverse hemodynamic effects with MT demonstrated during
      initiation persist with drug readministration during chronic therapy. METHODS:
      Patients were randomly assigned to 6.25 mg MT or 25 mg MS orally and the dose was
      gradually increased to a target of 50 mg twice a day or 100 mg once a day,
      respectively. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline and after three 
      months of therapy--both before and after drug readministration. RESULTS: Long
      term metoprolol therapy produced significant functional, exercise and hemodynamic
      benefits with no difference in response between either metoprolol preparation in 
      the 27 patients (MT [14], MS [13]). When full dose metoprolol was readministered 
      during chronic therapy, there were parallel adverse hemodynamic effects in both
      drug groups. Cardiac index decreased by 0.6 liters/min/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MT
      and by 0.5 liters/min/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MS. Systematic vascular resistance
      increased by 253 dyne-sec-cm(-5) (p < 0.001) with MT and by 267 dyne-sec-cm(-5)
      (p < 0.0005) with MS. Stroke volume index decreased by 7.0 ml/m2 (p < 0.0005)
      with MT and by 6.5 ml/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MS, while SWI decreased by 6.2 g-m/m2 
      (p < 0.0005) with MT and by 6.0 g-m/m2 (p < 0.001) with MS. CONCLUSION:
      Metoprolol tartrate and MS produce similar hemodynamic and clinical effects
      acutely and chronically despite the fourfold greater starting dose of MS used in 
      this study. A more rapid initiation with readily available starting doses of MS
      may offer distinct advantages compared with MT in treating chronic heart failure 
      patients with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.

TI  - Gemcitabine and cisplatin versus methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and
      cisplatin in advanced or metastatic bladder cancer: results of a large,
      randomized, multinational, multicenter, phase III study.
PG  - 3068-77
AB  - PURPOSE: Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) and methotrexate, vinblastine,
      doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) were compared in patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic transitional-cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urothelium. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Patients with stage IV TCC and no prior systemic chemotherapy were
      randomized to GC (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 days 1, 8 and 15; cisplatin 70 mg/m2
      day 2) or standard MVAC every 28 days for a maximum of six cycles. RESULTS: Four 
      hundred five patients were randomized (GC, n = 203; MVAC, n = 202). The groups
      were well-balanced with respect to prognostic factors. Overall survival was
      similar on both arms (hazards ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.82 to 1.32; P = .75), as were time to progressive disease (HR, 1.05; 95% CI,
      0.85 to 1.30), time to treatment failure (HR, 0.89; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.10), and
      response rate (GC, 49%; MVAC, 46%). More GC patients completed six cycles of
      therapy, with fewer dose adjustments. The toxic death rate was 1% on the GC arm
      and 3% on the MVAC arm. More GC than MVAC patients had grade 3/4 anemia (27% v
      18%, respectively), and thrombocytopenia (57% v 21%, respectively). On both arms,
      the RBC transfusion rate was 13 of 100 cycles and grade 3/4 hemorrhage or
      hematuria was 2%; the platelet transfusion rate was four patients per 100 cycles 
      and two patients per 100 cycles on GC and MVAC, respectively. More MVAC patients,
      compared with GC patients, had grade 3/4 neutropenia (82% v 71%, respectively),
      neutropenic fever (14% v 2%, respectively), neutropenic sepsis (12% v 1%,
      respectively), and grade 3/4 mucositis (22% v 1%, respectively) and alopecia (55%
      v 11%, respectively). Quality of life was maintained during treatment on both
      arms; however, more patients on GC fared better regarding weight, performance
      status, and fatigue. CONCLUSION: GC provides a similar survival advantage to MVAC
      with a better safety profile and tolerability. This better-risk benefit ratio
      should change the standard of care for patients with locally advanced and
      metastatic TCC from MVAC to GC.

TI  - Long-term efficacy and safety of fluticasone propionate powder administered once 
      or twice daily via inhaler to patients with moderate asthma.
PG  - 303-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluticasone propionate
      administered as a once-daily or twice-daily regimen over a period of 1 year to
      patients with moderate asthma. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, parallel group, 
      and placebo-controlled phase (12 weeks) and an open-label phase (54 weeks).
      SETTING: Multicenter study in an outpatient setting. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n = 
      253; age, > or = 12 years) with a mean FEV(1) of 67% predicted normal were
      stratified according to baseline therapy of maintenance inhaled corticosteroids
      vs beta(2)-agonists alone. MEASUREMENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Fluticasone propionate
      (250 microg bid or 500 microg qd) or placebo (bid) was administered via the
      Diskus multidose powder inhaler (Glaxo Wellcome; Research Triangle Park, NC) for 
      12 weeks. During open-label treatment, patients were re-randomized to once-daily 
      or twice-daily fluticasone propionate. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, fluticasone 
      propionate administered qd or bid significantly improved FEV(1) (p < 0.001),
      morning (p < 0.001) and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF; p < 0.001), asthma
      symptom scores (p < or = 0.001), and albuterol use (p </= 0.001), and decreased
      nighttime awakenings. By the end of 12 weeks, withdrawal due to lack of efficacy 
      was significantly higher in the placebo group than in the once-daily (p = 0.001) 
      or twice-daily (p < 0.001) groups. When comparing the two active dosing regimens,
      significant differences in favor of twice-daily dosing were noted in FEV(1),
      albuterol use, and withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. During 54 weeks of
      open-label treatment, FEV(1) and PEF continued to improve with both regimens, and
      improvements seen in the first 12 weeks were maintained in patients who switched 
      from twice-daily to once-daily dosing. Fluticasone propionate treatment over a
      54-week period was well tolerated, with few drug-related adverse events, which
      were primarily topical effects of inhaled corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS:
      Fluticasone propionate powder improved lung function when administered either qd 
      or bid over a 1-year period to patients with moderate asthma, with twice-daily
      dosing demonstrating significantly greater improvement in some efficacy
      parameters than once-daily dosing over the first 12 weeks of treatment.
      Fluticasone propionate treatment was not associated with significant systemic
      effects.

TI  - Total parenteral nutrition enriched with arginine and glutamate generates
      glutamine and limits protein catabolism in surgical patients hospitalized in
      intensive care units.
PG  - 3637-44
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of a parenteral nutrition solution enriched with 
      potential precursors of glutamine, i.e., arginine and glutamate, on plasma
      glutamine concentrations and protein metabolism. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized,
      single-blind, comparative study. SETTING: Two intensive care units in two
      different hospitals. PATIENTS: Fifteen surgical patients. INTERVENTIONS: Patients
      were randomized to receive total parenteral nutrition for 5 days with the
      enriched glutamine precursor solution (GlnP+ group) or a conventional solution
      (control group), both total parenteral nutrition providing 0.25 gN/kg per day and
      35 kcal/kg per day (glucose/lipids, 70%:30%). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
      Plasma amino acid concentrations before (T0) and after 3 hrs (T3) of perfusion,
      nitrogen balance (daily and cumulated), and urinary excretion of
      3-methylhistidine were measured daily from day 1 to day 5. The two groups were
      identical for age, weight, severity score, and nitrogen and energy intakes. After
      a 3-hr perfusion, plasma concentrations of arginine, ornithine, and glutamine
      increased, and the differences (T3 - T0) were significantly higher in the GlnP+
      group: arginine, 107.6+/-7.0 vs. 51.9+/-3.3 (mean over 5 days; p < .001);
      ornithine, 78.9+/-7.1 vs. 43.6+/-3.1 (p < .001); and glutamine, 32.4+/-8.6 vs.
      6.7+/-5.0 micromol/L (p < .05), respectively. A positive correlation was found
      between arginine and glutamine plasma increases only in the GlnP+ group: r = .45;
      p < .01 (Spearman's rank-correlation test). Daily and cumulated nitrogen balances
      were not significantly different between the two groups but were positive
      (difference from 0) only in the GlnP+ group. The urinary
      3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratio decreased significantly from day 1 to day 5
      only in the GlnP+ group: 24.5+/-2.7 vs. 18.8+/-2.7 micromol/mmol (p < .05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Total parenteral nutrition enriched with arginine and glutamate
      promotes a better nitrogen balance, limits protein myofibrillar catabolism, and
      generates glutamine, with arginine (not glutamate) probably being the main
      contributor to the glutamine-generating effect of the solution through the
      formation of ornithine.

TI  - Differential effects of oral and transdermal estrogen replacement therapy on
      endothelial function in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 2687-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: We determined whether the vascular effects of estradiol depend on the
      route of administration by comparing the effects of oral estradiol and
      transdermal placebo, transdermal estradiol and oral placebo, and transdermal
      placebo and oral placebo on in vivo endothelial function in 27 postmenopausal
      women. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelial function was assessed from blood flow
      responses to intrabrachial artery infusions of endothelium-dependent (7.5 and 15 
      microgram/min acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (3 and 10 microgram/min 
      of sodium nitroprusside) vasodilators at 0, 2, and 12 weeks. In the oral
      estradiol group, the increase in flow above basal during infusion of the low dose
      of acetylcholine at 0, 2, and 12 weeks averaged 6.0+/-0.8, 6.9+/-0.8, and
      11.3+/-1.2 (P<0.01 versus 0 and 2 weeks) mL. dL(-1). min(-1) at 0, 2, and 12
      weeks. The percentage increases versus 0 weeks averaged 21+/-14% at 2 and
      120+/-34% at 12 weeks. During the high-dose acetylcholine infusion, the increase 
      in flow above basal averaged 8.6+/-1.3, 10.2+/-1.5, and 15.1+/-1.8 (P<0.05 versus
      0 weeks) mL. dL(-1). min(-1), respectively. The percentage increases versus 0
      weeks averaged 22+/-10% at 2 weeks and 119+/-46% at 12 weeks. In the oral
      estradiol group, endothelium-independent vasodilatation also improved
      significantly, but less markedly than endothelium-dependent responses. In the
      transdermal and placebo groups, all vascular responses remained unchanged. Oral
      but not transdermal estradiol also induced significant decreases in LDL
      cholesterol and Lp(a) concentrations and an increase in HDL cholesterol within 2 
      weeks. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that oral but not transdermal estradiol induces
      potentially antiatherogenic changes in in vivo endothelium-dependent
      vasodilatation and lipid concentrations.

TI  - Effects of ramipril on cardiovascular and microvascular outcomes in people with
      diabetes mellitus: results of the HOPE study and MICRO-HOPE substudy. Heart
      Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study Investigators.
PG  - 253-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular and
      renal disease. We investigated whether the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitor ramipril can lower these risks in patients with diabetes. METHODS: 3577
      people with diabetes included in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, 
      aged 55 years or older, who had a previous cardiovascular event or at least one
      other cardiovascular risk factor, no clinical proteinuria, heart failure, or low 
      ejection fraction, and who were not taking ACE inhibitors, were randomly assigned
      ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo, and vitamin E or placebo, according to a
      two-by-two factorial design. The combined primary outcome was myocardial
      infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Overt nephropathy was a main outcome
      in a substudy. FINDINGS: The study was stopped 6 months early (after 4.5 years)
      by the independent data safety and monitoring board because of a consistent
      benefit of ramipril compared with placebo. Ramipril lowered the risk of the
      combined primary outcome by 25% (95% CI 12-36, p=0.0004), myocardial infarction
      by 22% (6-36), stroke by 33% (10-50), cardiovascular death by 37% (21-51), total 
      mortality by 24% (8-37), revascularisation by 17% (2-30), and overt nephropathy
      by 24% (3-40, p=0.027). After adjustment for the changes in systolic (2.4 mm Hg) 
      and diastolic (1.0 mm Hg) blood pressures, ramipril still lowered the risk of the
      combined primary outcome by 25% (12-36, p=0.0004). INTERPRETATION: Ramipril was
      beneficial for cardiovascular events and overt nephropathy in people with
      diabetes. The cardiovascular benefit was greater than that attributable to the
      decrease in blood pressure. This treatment represents a vasculoprotective and
      renoprotective effect for people with diabetes.

TI  - Prolonged use of heat and moisture exchangers does not affect device efficiency
      or frequency rate of nosocomial pneumonia.
PG  - 1412-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether use of a single heat and moisture exchanger (HME)
      for < or =120 hrs affects efficiency, resistance, level of bacterial
      colonization, frequency rate of nosocomial pneumonia, and cost compared with
      changing the HME every 24 hrs. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, randomized,
      unblinded study. SETTING: Surgical intensive care unit at a university teaching
      hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 220 consecutive patients requiring mechanical
      ventilation for >48 hrs. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to one of three 
      groups: a) hygroscopic HME (Aqua+) changed every 24 hrs (HHME-24); b) hydrophobic
      HME (Duration HME) changed every 120 hrs (HME-120); and c) hygroscopic HME
      (Aqua+) changed every 120 hrs (HHME-120). Devices in all groups could be changed 
      at the discretion of the staff when signs of occlusion or increased resistance
      were identified. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Daily measurements of inspired
      gas temperature, inspired relative humidity, and device resistance were made.
      Additionally, daily cultures of the patient side of the device were accomplished.
      The frequency rate of nosocomial pneumonia was made by using clinical criteria.
      Ventilatory support variables, airway care, device costs, and clinical indicators
      of humidification efficiency (sputum volume, sputum efficiency) were also
      recorded. Prolonged use of both hygroscopic and hydrophobic devices did not
      diminish efficiency or increase resistance. There was no difference in the number
      of colony-forming units from device cultures over the 5-day period and no
      difference between colony-forming units in devices changed every 24 hrs compared 
      with devices changed after 120 hrs. The average duration of use was 23+/-4 hrs in
      the HHME-24 group, 73+/-13 hrs in the HME-120 group, and 74+/-9 hrs in the
      HHME-120 group. Mean absolute humidity was greater for the hygroscopic devices
      (30.4+/-1.1 mg of H2O/L) compared with the hydrophobic devices (27.8+/-1.3 mg of 
      H2O/L). The frequency rate of nosocomial pneumonia was 8% (8:100) in the HHME-24 
      group, 8.3% (5:60) in the HME-120 group, and 6.6% (4:60) in the HHME-120 group.
      Pneumonia rates per 1000 ventilatory support days were 20:1000 in the HHME-24
      group, 20.8:1000 in the HME-120 group, and 16.6:1000 in the HHME-120 group. Costs
      per day were $3.24 for the HHME-24 group, $2.98 for the HME-120 group, and $1.65 
      for the HHME-120 group. CONCLUSIONS: Changing the hydrophobic or hygroscopic HME 
      after 3 days does not diminish efficiency, increase resistance, or alter
      bacterial colonization. The frequency rate of nosocomial pneumonia was also
      unchanged. Use of HMEs for >24 hrs, up to 72 hrs, is safe and cost effective.

TI  - Statistical methods to improve the precision of the treadmill exercise test.
PG  - 1274-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study systematically compared different measures of ST segment
      depression from the treadmill exercise test. BACKGROUND: The value of the
      treadmill exercise test for objectively measuring treatment effects is limited by
      random error in the measurement of ST depression and may be biased by regression 
      to the mean or by the decision to terminate the test. METHODS: Treadmill exercise
      was performed in 21 subjects with ischemic heart disease 1 h after isosorbide
      dinitrate 10 mg or placebo in a double-blind randomized crossover study. A
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded every 30 s during and at peak
      exercise. The relative sample size needed to detect the nitrate effect was
      compared for different summary measures of ST depression. RESULTS: The ST
      depression measured from a single unmatched lead at longest equivalent
      sub-maximal exercise needed the lowest sample size to detect the nitrate effect
      in paired comparisons (p = 0.000006). Averaging over multiple leads or times did 
      not improve detection of the nitrate effect. The rate of increase in ST
      depression (in mm/min) calculated by linear regression needed a similar sample
      size (x1.32, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.58). A larger sample size was needed for ST
      depression at peak exercise (x2.9, CI 1.3, 11.1) and exercise duration (x4.5, CI 
      1.5, 38). Time to 1-mm ST depression was the least efficient measurement
      (relative sample size x15.5, CI 1.6, >1,000). Comparison of matched leads
      resulted in >2-fold differences in estimates of the nitrate effect because of
      bias from regression to the mean. CONCLUSIONS: Maximal ST depression at longest
      equivalent sub-maximal exercise and the maximal rate of increase in ST depression
      had less bias and random variation than did other commonly used measures. The
      rate of increase in ST depression is preferred because it can be calculated in
      either paired or unpaired studies.

TI  - Tension-free hernia repair is associated with an increase in inflammatory
      response markers against the mesh.
PG  - 203-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the involvement of
      inflammatory mediators in patients undergoing Lichtenstein tension-free
      hernioplasty (LH) using polypropylene prosthetic materials or conventional
      Bassini hernia repair (BH). METHODS: Thirty patients male with unilateral
      inguinal hernia without complications or recurrence were included in this study. 
      Randomly, patients underwent LH or BH. Peripheral venous bloods samples were
      collected 24 hours prior to surgery and then 6, 24, 48 and 168 hours
      postoperatively. RESULTS: We present evidences that LH patients showed a higher
      increased serum level of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and
      interleukin-6 than BH patients. Postoperative visual analogue scales for pain
      were reduced on mobilization for patients undergoing LH compared with BH.
      Neutrophils were significantly increased only in LH compared with baseline.
      Ceruloplasmin, transferrin, and albumin levels were unmodified after BH or LH.
      CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion our data show that although LH induces less pain and
      more rapid postoperative recovery, it is associated with an higher inflammatory
      response compared with BH, likely due to polypropylene mesh.

TI  - Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitor, ramipril, in patients with coronary or other occlusive arterial
      disease. PART-2 Collaborative Research Group. Prevention of Atherosclerosis with 
      Ramipril.
PG  - 438-43
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of
      the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, on carotid
      atherosclerosis in patients with coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular
      disease. BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to 
      reduce the risk of coronary events in various patient groups and to prevent the
      development of atherosclerosis in animal models. It has been hypothesized that
      the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors may, therefore, be mediated by effects on
      atherosclerosis. METHODS: Six hundred seventeen patients were randomized in equal
      proportions to ramipril (5-10 mg daily) or placebo. At baseline, two years and
      four years, carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasound, and left
      ventricular mass was assessed by M-mode echocardiography. RESULTS: Blood pressure
      (BP) was reduced by a mean of 6 mm Hg systolic and 4 mm Hg diastolic in the
      ramipril group compared with the placebo group (p<0.001). There was no difference
      between groups in the changes in common carotid artery wall thickness (p = 0.58) 
      or in carotid plaque (p = 0.93). Left ventricular mass index decreased by 3.8
      g/m2 (4%) in the ramipril group compared with the placebo group (2p = 0.04).
      CONCLUSIONS: The results provide no support for the hypothesis that reduced
      atherosclerosis is responsible for the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on
      major coronary events. It is more likely that the benefits are due to lower BP,
      reduced left ventricular mass or other factors such as reversal of endothelial
      dysfunction.

TI  - Low-dose budesonide with the addition of an increased dose during exacerbations
      is effective in long-term asthma control. On behalf of the Italian Study Group.
PG  - 440-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare the effects of a 6-month treatment
      with budesonide 100 microg bid (low dose) and 400 microg bid (standard reference 
      dose) in controlling symptoms and lung function in a group of asthmatics with
      moderate asthma (baseline FEV(1) > or = 50% and < or = 90% of predicted values)
      previously treated with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (500 to 1,000
      microg/d). Moreover, we investigated whether or not asthma exacerbations could be
      treated by a short-term increase in the daily dose of budesonide. METHODS: After 
      a 2-week run-in period and 1-month treatment with a high dose of budesonide (800 
      microg bid), 213 patients with moderate asthma were assigned to randomized
      treatments. Daily treatment included budesonide (bid) plus an additional
      treatment in case of exacerbation (qid for 7 days). Treatments were as follows:
      budesonide 400 microg plus placebo (group 1); budesonide 100 microg plus
      budesonide 200 microg (group 2); and budesonide 100 microg plus placebo (group
      3). Symptoms and a peak expiratory flow (PEF) diary were recorded and lung
      function was measured each month. An exacerbation was defined as a decrease in
      PEF > 30% below baseline values on 2 consecutive days. RESULTS: We found that
      that 1-month treatment with a high budesonide dose remarkably reduced all asthma 
      symptoms. Moreover, symptoms were under control in all treatment groups
      throughout the study period. Similarly, lung function improved and remained
      stable, and no relevant differences between groups were observed. In each
      treatment group, the majority of patients had no exacerbations. In patients
      treated with the standard budesonide dose (group 1), the number of exacerbations 
      and days with exacerbations were significantly lower than in group 3
      (intention-to-treat analysis). Additionally, patients treated with low budesonide
      dose plus budesonide (group 2) experienced a significantly lower number of
      exacerbations and days with exacerbations compared to group 3 (per-protocol
      analysis). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that when patients with moderate 
      asthma had reached a stable clinical condition with a high dose of budesonide, a 
      low dose of budesonide (200 microg/d) is as effective as the standard dose (800
      microg/d) in the control of symptoms and lung function over a period of several
      months. Furthermore, results showed that the addition of inhaled budesonide (800 
      microg/d) at onset of an asthmatic exacerbation has a beneficial clinical effect.

TI  - Fluoxetine for bulimia nervosa following poor response to psychotherapy.
PG  - 1332-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This was an investigation of whether treatment with fluoxetine is
      useful for individuals with bulimia nervosa who do not respond to psychotherapy
      or relapse afterward. METHOD: Twenty-two patients with bulimia nervosa who had
      not responded to, or had relapsed following, a course of cognitive behavior
      therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy were randomly assigned to receive placebo 
      (N=9) or fluoxetine (60 mg/day, N=13) for 8 weeks. RESULTS: The median frequency 
      of binge eating in the previous 28 days declined from 22 to four episodes in the 
      fluoxetine group but increased from 15 to 18 episodes in the placebo group.
      Similarly, purging frequency in the previous 28 days declined from 30 to six
      episodes in the fluoxetine group but increased from 15 to 38 episodes in the
      placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine may be a useful intervention for patients 
      with bulimia nervosa who have not responded adequately to psychological
      treatment.

TI  - A comparison of paracentesis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting
      in patients with ascites.
PG  - 1701-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, creation of a transjugular
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may reduce the ascites and improve renal
      function. However, the benefit of this procedure as compared with that of
      large-volume paracentesis is uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned 60 patients
      with cirrhosis and refractory or recurrent ascites (Child-Pugh class B in 42
      patients and class C in 18 patients) to treatment with a transjugular shunt (29
      patients) or large-volume paracentesis (31 patients). The mean (+/-SD) duration
      of follow-up was 45+/-16 months among those assigned to shunting and 44+/-18
      months among those assigned to paracentesis. The primary outcome was survival
      without liver transplantation. RESULTS: Among the patients in the shunt group, 15
      died and 1 underwent liver transplantation during the study period, as compared
      with 23 patients and 2 patients, respectively, in the paracentesis group. The
      probability of survival without liver transplantation was 69 percent at one year 
      and 58 percent at two years in the shunt group, as compared with 52 percent and
      32 percent in the paracentesis group (P=0.11 for the overall comparison, by the
      log-rank test). In a multivariate analysis, treatment with transjugular shunting 
      was independently associated with survival without the need for transplantation
      (P=0.02). At three months, 61 percent of the patients in the shunt group and 18
      percent of those in the paracentesis group had no ascites (P=0.006). The
      frequency of hepatic encephalopathy was similar in the two groups. Of the
      patients assigned to paracentesis in whom this procedure was unsuccessful, 10
      received a transjugular shunt a mean of 5.5+/-4 months after randomization; 4 had
      a response to this rescue treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with large-volume
      paracentesis, the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt can
      improve the chance of survival without liver transplantation in patients with
      refractory or recurrent ascites.

TI  - Physiotherapy for anterior knee pain: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 700-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of the individual components of
      physiotherapy in subjects with anterior knee pain. METHODS: An observer blind,
      prospective, factorial design randomised controlled trial. 81 young adults with
      anterior knee pain were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: (1)
      exercise, taping, and education; (2) exercise and education; (3) taping and
      education; and (4) education alone. Each group received six physiotherapist-led
      treatments over three months. Follow up took place at three months using the
      following outcome measures: patient satisfaction (discharge/refer for further
      treatment); a visual analogue pain score; the WOMAC lower limb function score;
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD); and quadriceps strength. At 12
      months the WOMAC and HAD were assessed by postal questionnaire. RESULTS: All
      groups showed significant improvements in WOMAC, visual analogue, and HAD scores;
      these improvements did not vary significantly between the four groups or between 
      exercising/non-exercising and taped/non-taped patients at three and 12 months.
      However, patients who exercised were significantly more likely to be discharged
      at three months than non-exercising patients (chi(2), p<0.001). Taping was not
      significantly associated with discharge. Significantly greater improvements in
      WOMAC, visual analogue, and the anxiety score (but not the depression score) were
      seen in patients who were discharged than in those who were referred.
      CONCLUSIONS: The proprioceptive muscle stretching and strengthening aspects of
      physiotherapy have a beneficial effect at three months sufficient to permit
      discharge from physiotherapy. These benefits are maintained at one year. Taping
      does not influence the outcome.

TI  - Mifepristone for preinduction cervical ripening beyond 41 weeks' gestation: a
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 543-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of mifepristone with placebo on cervical
      ripening before labor induction in prolonged pregnancies. METHODS: One hundred
      eighty women with pregnancies beyond 41 weeks and undilated, uneffaced cervices
      were assigned randomly to receive mifepristone 200 mg or placebo and observed for
      24 hours. We then gave intravaginal misoprostol 25 microg every 4 hours or
      intravenous oxytocin. We expected 60% of placebo-treated and 80% of
      mifepristone-treated women to deliver vaginally within 48 hours. RESULTS: Among
      180 subjects, 97 received mifepristone and 83 received placebo. The mean interval
      (+/- standard deviation [SD]) from start of induction to delivery was 2209 +/-
      698 minutes for mifepristone-treated subjects and 2671 +/- 884 minutes for
      placebo-treated subjects (P <.001, log-transformed data). Twelve (13. 6%)
      mifepristone-treated women and seven (10.8%) placebo-treated women delivered
      vaginally on day 1 (P =.60). After 24 hours, the median Bishop score for both
      groups was 3 (0-11) (P =.51). One hundred thirty-one subjects required
      misoprostol, 65 (67.0%) were mifepristone-treated women, and 66 (79.5%)
      placebo-treated women (P =.06). The median (range) oxytocin dose was 871.5
      (0-22,174) mU for mifepristone-treated women and 2021.0 (0-24,750) mU for
      placebo-treated women (P =.02). Seventy-seven (87.5%) mifepristone-treated women 
      and 46 (70.8%) placebo-treated women delivered vaginally 48 hours after the start
      of treatment (P =.01). There were nine cesareans in the mifepristone group and 18
      in the placebo group (P =.02). More nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns and
      uterine contractile abnormalities occurred in mifepristone-treated subjects.
      There were no statistically significant differences in neonatal outcomes between 
      groups. CONCLUSION: Mifepristone had a modest effect on cervical ripening when
      given 24 hours before labor induction, appearing to reduce the need for
      misoprostol and oxytocin compared with placebo.

TI  - Effect of an esophageal bougie on the incidence of dysphagia following nissen
      fundoplication: a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 1055-61; discussion 1061-2
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Based on retrospective, uncontrolled studies, it has been claimed
      that Nissen fundoplication should be performed over an esophageal bougie to
      minimize postoperative dysphagia. We hypothesized that a surgeon experienced in
      laparoscopic fundoplication will have similar rates of postoperative dysphagia
      whether or not an esophageal bougie is used. DESIGN: A patient and observer
      blinded, randomized, prospective clinical trial to assess the effect of
      intraoperative bougie use. SETTING: A tertiary care teaching hospital that is a
      regional referral source for complex laparoscopic foregut surgical procedures.
      PATIENTS: Three hundred thirty-six consecutive patients referred for laparoscopic
      fundoplication between March 1, 1996, and July 31, 1998, were evaluated for
      eligibility based on inclusion criteria and, if applicable, were offered
      randomization for fundoplication with or without a 56F bougie. One hundred
      seventy-one patients were enrolled in this study. INTERVENTIONS: All patients
      underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, 81 with a bougie (hereafter
      referred to as the bougie group) and 90 without a bougie (hereafter referred to
      as the no bougie group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dysphagia severity and frequency 
      were assessed by a blinded observer using a standardized scoring system.
      Incidence of complications related to the use or absence of a bougie, operative
      times, and postsurgical recovery was also assessed. RESULTS: The mean operating
      time was 148 minutes (range, 65-295 minutes). The overall operative morbidity was
      9% (7. 4% in the bougie group and 11% in the no bougie group, P=.41). One
      esophageal injury (1.2%) occurred in the bougie group. The 30-day mortality was
      0. Long-term dysphagia assessment was completed in 90% of patients, with a mean
      follow-up of 11 months. Overall, long-term postoperative dysphagia was present in
      13 patients (17%) in the bougie group and 24 patients(31%) in the no bougie group
      (P=.047). Severe dysphagia occurred in 5% of patients in the bougie group and 14%
      in the no bougie group. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the dogma that use of a
      large-caliber stent during the creation of a fundoplication decreases the
      long-term incidence of dysphagia; albeit at the risk of injury from the
      introduction of a bougie.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle modifications have been recommended as the initial
      treatment strategy for lowering high blood pressure (BP). However, evidence for
      the efficacy of exercise and weight loss in the management of high BP remains
      controversial. METHODS: One hundred thirty-three sedentary, overweight men and
      women with unmedicated high normal BP or stage 1 to 2 hypertension were randomly 
      assigned to aerobic exercise only; a behavioral weight management program,
      including exercise; or a waiting list control group. Before and following
      treatment, systolic and diastolic BPs were measured in the clinic, during daily
      life, and during exercise and mental stress testing. Hemodynamic measures and
      metabolic functioning also were assessed. RESULTS: Although participants in both 
      active treatment groups exhibited significant reductions in BP relative to
      controls, those in the weight management group generally had larger reductions.
      Weight management was associated with a 7-mm Hg systolic and a 5-mm Hg diastolic 
      clinic BP reduction, compared with a 4-mm Hg systolic and diastolic BP reduction 
      associated with aerobic exercise; the BP for controls did not change.
      Participants in both treatment groups also displayed reduced peripheral
      resistance and increased cardiac output compared with controls, with the greatest
      reductions in peripheral resistance in those in the weight management group.
      Weight management participants also exhibited significantly lower fasting and
      postprandial glucose and insulin levels than participants in the other groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although exercise alone was effective in reducing BP, the addition
      of a behavioral weight loss program enhanced this effect. Aerobic exercise
      combined with weight loss is recommended for the management of elevated BP in
      sedentary, overweight individuals.

TI  - Resuscitation of critically ill patients based on the results of gastric
      tonometry: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 607-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether additional therapy aimed at correcting low
      gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) improves outcome in conventionally resuscitated,
      critically ill patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study.
      SETTING: General intensive care unit (ICU) of a university teaching hospital.
      PATIENTS: A total of 210 adult patients, with a median Acute Physiology and
      Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 24 (range, 8-51). INTERVENTIONS: All
      patients were resuscitated according to standard guidelines. After resuscitation,
      those patients in the intervention group with a pHi of <7.35 were treated with
      additional colloid and then dobutamine (5 microg/kg/min then 10 microg/kg min)
      until 24 hrs after enrollment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were no
      significant differences (p > .05) in ICU mortality (39.6% in the control group
      vs. 38.5% in the intervention group), hospital mortality (45.3% in the control
      group vs. 42.3% in the intervention group), and 30-day mortality (43.7% in the
      control group vs. 40.2 in the intervention group); survival curves; median
      modified maximal multiorgan dysfunction score (10 points in the control group vs.
      13 points in the intervention group); median modified duration of ICU stay (12
      days in the control group vs. 11.5 days in the intervention group); or median
      modified duration of hospital stay (60 days in the control group vs. 42 days in
      the intervention group). A subgroup analysis of those patients with gastric
      mucosal pH of > or =7.35 at admission revealed no difference in ICU mortality
      (10.3% in the control group vs. 14.8% in the intervention group), hospital
      mortality (13.8% in the control group vs. 29.6% in the intervention group), or
      30-day mortality (10.3% in the control group vs. 26.9% in the intervention
      group). CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of treatment titrated against pHi in the
      management of critically ill patients cannot be supported. Failure to improve
      outcome may be caused by an inability to produce a clinically significant change 
      in pHi or because pHi is simply a marker of disease rather than a factor in the
      pathogenesis of multiorgan failure.

TI  - Cost for inpatient care of venous thrombosis: a trial of enoxaparin vs standard
      heparin.
PG  - 3160-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin administered to
      hospitalized patients once or twice daily, has shown efficacy and safety
      equivalent to unfractionated heparin in the treatment of acute venous
      thromboembolic disease. Although the cost of either enoxaparin regimen is greater
      than that of unfractionated heparin, the overall cost of care for each of these 3
      treatment strategies is unknown. METHODS: A cost minimization analysis of a
      3-month, partially blinded, randomized, controlled efficacy and safety trial of
      anticoagulant therapy for deep vein thrombosis. Three hundred thirty-nine
      hospitalized patients with symptomatic lower extremity deep vein thrombosis were 
      randomly assigned to initial therapy with subcutaneous enoxaparin either once (n 
      = 112) or twice (n = 123) daily, or with dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated
      heparin (n = 104), followed by long-term oral anticoagulant therapy. Estimated
      1997 total cost from a third-party payer perspective for the 3-month episode of
      care was calculated by assigning standard unit costs to counts of medical
      resources used by each patient in the clinical trial. RESULTS: Average total cost
      for the 3-month episode of care was similar across all 3 treatment regimens:
      once-daily dose of enoxaparin, $12,166 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      $10,744-$13,588); twice-daily dose of enoxaparin, $11,558 (95% CI,
      $10,201-$12,915); and unfractionated heparin, $12,146 (95% CI, $10,670-$12,622). 
      Bootstrapped estimates and sensitivity analyses did not significantly change
      findings. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in the overall cost
      for the 3-month episode of care for patients treated with either enoxaparin or
      unfractionated heparin. Additional acquisition costs for anticoagulant medication
      among patients treated with enoxaparin were offset by savings associated with
      lower incidence of hospital readmission and shorter duration of venous
      thromboembolism-related readmissions.

TI  - The triple P-positive parenting program: a comparison of enhanced, standard, and 
      self-directed behavioral family intervention for parents of children with early
      onset conduct problems.
PG  - 624-40
AB  - Three variants of a behavioral family intervention (BFI) program known as Triple 
      P were compared using 305 preschoolers at high risk of developing conduct
      problems. Families were randomly assigned to enhanced BFI (EBFI), standard BFI
      (SBFI), self-directed BFI (SDBFI), or wait list (WL). At postintervention, the 2 
      practitioner-assisted conditions were associated with lower levels of
      parent-reported disruptive child behavior, lower levels of dysfunctional
      parenting, greater parental competence, and higher consumer satisfaction than the
      SDBFI and WL conditions. Overall, children in EBFI showed greater reliable
      improvement than children in SBFI, SDBFI, and WL. By 1-year follow-up, children
      in all 3 conditions achieved similar levels of clinically reliable change in
      observed disruptive behavior. However, the EBFI and SBFI conditions showed
      greater reliable improvement on parent-observed disruptive child behavior.

TI  - A crossover study of triptorelin and leuprorelin acetate.
PG  - 299-305
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the potency, side effects, and duration of action of
      triptorelin and leuprorelin acetate after i.m. injections. DESIGN: Prospective,
      double-blind crossover clinical study. SETTING: A teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): 
      Fifty-four patients with pelvic endometriosis. INTERVENTION(S): Twenty-seven
      patients had three doses of i.m. triptorelin (3.75 mg) followed by three doses of
      i.m. leuprorelin acetate at 4-week intervals. Twenty-one patients had three doses
      of i.m. leuprorelin acetate (3.75 mg) followed by three doses of i.m.
      triptorelin, also at 4-week intervals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Menopausal
      symptoms, time taken for menstruation to return, serum E(2), FSH, LH levels,
      lipid profiles, and liver function tests. RESULT(S): The potencies of triptorelin
      and leuprorelin acetate in lowering the serum E(2), FSH, and LH levels were
      comparable. The severity of menopausal symptoms, changes in the lipid profile and
      liver function parameters were similar after triptorelin and leuprorelin acetate.
      The resurgence of ovarian activities and the spontaneous return of menstruation
      occurred significantly earlier after leuprorelin acetate than triptorelin.
      CONCLUSION(S): Both drugs are equally potent in down-regulating the
      pituitary-ovarian function, and their side effects are similar. Triptorelin has a
      longer duration of drug action and can be administered over a longer interval
      period.

TI  - Empowering diabetes out-patients with structured education: short-term and
      long-term effects of functional insulin treatment on perceived control over
      diabetes.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate short-term and long-term effects of structured
      outpatient education for Functional Insulin Treatment (FIT: selective insulin
      dosages for eating, fasting or correcting hyperglycaemia) on perceived control
      over diabetes and related health beliefs. FIT was thought to influence the
      perception of self-efficacy in diabetes, in contrast to conventional treatment,
      based on scheduled, rigid food intake and insulin delivery--it allows flexible
      eating, provided independent control of glycemia. METHODS: Structured,
      comprehensive, outpatient group training in FIT for selective use of insulin
      either for eating, fasting or correction included practical "insulin games." The 
      FIT program focused on everyday criteria for choices of insulin dosages and thus 
      on the patient's ability to execute his/her newly gained flexible treatment to
      his/her everyday life while preventing acute and late complications. To evaluate 
      effects of FIT on "Perceived Control over Diabetes" and related "Health Beliefs
      Concerning Diabetes" (Bradley's questionnaires, 1984), a fully randomized
      short-term controlled Study 1 (four weeks, 32 patients), and long-term
      uncontrolled pilot Study 2 (three years, 68 patients) were performed. RESULTS:
      The short-term study revealed that FIT induced the feeling of independence from
      situational control while self-managing diabetes. In the long-term study, the
      patients were increasingly freed from the feeling of being under the control of
      physician and treatment-related restrictions, which--together with higher
      perceived self-efficacy--contributed to the feeling of "empowerment." This was
      associated with high treatment satisfaction and significant improvement of
      glycemic control. CONCLUSION: Structured out-patient group training for FIT
      results in measurable improvement of patients' perceived control over diabetes
      and self-efficacy.

TI  - Rabeprazole versus ranitidine for the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Raberprazole Study
      Group.
PG  - 1894-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 
      the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole to that of the histamine-2 (H2)-receptor
      antagonist ranitidine in the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal reflux
      disease. The primary indicator of efficacy was the absence of esophageal erosions
      or ulcerations as determined by posttreatment endoscopy. Secondary indicators of 
      efficacy included improvement in frequency and severity of daytime and nighttime 
      heartburn. METHODS: A total of 338 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned
      to therapy with rabeprazole 20 mg once daily in the morning or to ranitidine 150 
      mg four times daily. At baseline and at 4 wk, patients underwent endoscopy for
      evaluation of esophageal lesions. Patients whose lesions healed by wk 4 had
      therapy discontinued; others remained on therapy and had repeat endoscopy at 8
      wk. Also recorded at study visits were patients' ratings of heartburn symptoms
      and overall sense of well being, patients' reports of time lost from daily
      activities, antacid use, and adverse events. Serum gastrin levels were measured
      and argyrophil enterochromaffin-like cell histology evaluated at baseline and
      when the patient ended therapy. RESULTS: At wk 4, healing was observed in 59%
      (98/167) of patients assigned to rabeprazole therapy, compared with 36% (60/169) 
      of those receiving ranitidine (p < 0.001). By 8 wk, healing was seen in 87%
      (146/167) and 66% (112/169) of patients in the rabeprazole and ranitidine groups,
      respectively (p < 0.001). There were also significant differences between the two
      groups favoring rabeprazole with respect to resolution or improvement of
      heartburn symptoms and improvement in sense of well-being. No drug-related
      serious adverse events were seen with either therapy; fewer patients assigned to 
      rabeprazole had treatment-emergent signs and symptoms. Serum gastrin levels
      increased over baseline in the rabeprazole group, but the mean value remained
      within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole was superior to ranitidine in
      esophageal healing and symptom relief in patients with erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease, and was equally well tolerated.

TI  - Alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis in men.
PG  - 604-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite its association with disability, death, and increased medical
      costs, osteoporosis in men has been relatively neglected as a subject of study.
      There have been no large, controlled trials of treatment in men. METHODS: In a
      two-year double-blind trial, we studied the effect of 10 mg of alendronate or
      placebo, given daily, on bone mineral density in 241 men (age, 31 to 87 years;
      mean, 63) with osteoporosis. Approximately one third had low serum free
      testosterone concentrations at base line; the rest had normal concentrations. Men
      with other secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. All the men received
      calcium and vitamin D supplements. The main outcome measures were the percent
      changes in lumbar-spine, hip, and total-body bone mineral density. RESULTS: The
      men who received alendronate had a mean (+/-SE) increase in bone mineral density 
      of 7.1+/-0.3 percent at the lumbar spine, 2.5+/-0.4 percent at the femoral neck, 
      and 2.0+/-0.2 percent for the total body (P<0.001 for all comparisons with base
      line). In contrast, men who received placebo had an increase in lumbar-spine bone
      mineral density of 1.8+/-0.5 percent (P<0.001 for the comparison with base line) 
      and no significant changes in femoral-neck or total-body bone mineral density.
      The increase in bone mineral density in the alendronate group was greater than
      that in the placebo group at all measurement sites (P<0.001). The incidence of
      vertebral fractures was lower in the alendronate group than in the placebo group 
      (0.8 percent vs. 7.1 percent, P=0.02). Men in the placebo group had a 2.4-mm
      decrease in height, as compared with a decrease of 0.6 mm in the alendronate
      group (P=0.02). Alendronate was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: In men
      with osteoporosis, alendronate significantly increases spine, hip, and total-body
      bone mineral density and helps prevent vertebral fractures and decreases in
      height.

TI  - Rabeprazole versus ranitidine for the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Raberprazole Study
      Group.
PG  - 1894-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 
      the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole to that of the histamine-2 (H2)-receptor
      antagonist ranitidine in the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal reflux
      disease. The primary indicator of efficacy was the absence of esophageal erosions
      or ulcerations as determined by posttreatment endoscopy. Secondary indicators of 
      efficacy included improvement in frequency and severity of daytime and nighttime 
      heartburn. METHODS: A total of 338 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned
      to therapy with rabeprazole 20 mg once daily in the morning or to ranitidine 150 
      mg four times daily. At baseline and at 4 wk, patients underwent endoscopy for
      evaluation of esophageal lesions. Patients whose lesions healed by wk 4 had
      therapy discontinued; others remained on therapy and had repeat endoscopy at 8
      wk. Also recorded at study visits were patients' ratings of heartburn symptoms
      and overall sense of well being, patients' reports of time lost from daily
      activities, antacid use, and adverse events. Serum gastrin levels were measured
      and argyrophil enterochromaffin-like cell histology evaluated at baseline and
      when the patient ended therapy. RESULTS: At wk 4, healing was observed in 59%
      (98/167) of patients assigned to rabeprazole therapy, compared with 36% (60/169) 
      of those receiving ranitidine (p < 0.001). By 8 wk, healing was seen in 87%
      (146/167) and 66% (112/169) of patients in the rabeprazole and ranitidine groups,
      respectively (p < 0.001). There were also significant differences between the two
      groups favoring rabeprazole with respect to resolution or improvement of
      heartburn symptoms and improvement in sense of well-being. No drug-related
      serious adverse events were seen with either therapy; fewer patients assigned to 
      rabeprazole had treatment-emergent signs and symptoms. Serum gastrin levels
      increased over baseline in the rabeprazole group, but the mean value remained
      within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole was superior to ranitidine in
      esophageal healing and symptom relief in patients with erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease, and was equally well tolerated.

TI  - Tamoxifen adjuvant treatment duration in early breast cancer: initial results of 
      a randomized study comparing short-term treatment with long-term treatment.
      Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer Breast Group.
PG  - 3507-12
AB  - PURPOSE: In 1986, The Federation Nationale desCentres de Lutte Contre le Cancer
      Breast Group initiated a multicenter randomized trial to assess the usefulness of
      long-term adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Short-term adjuvant tamoxifen treatment
      was to be compared with life long adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Patients who were disease-free after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen 
      treatment were eligible for the trial. From September 1986 to May 1995, 3,793
      patients were randomized from France, Belgium, and Argentina. A total of 1,882
      patients stopped tamoxifen (short-term group), and 1,911 patients were to
      continue tamoxifen for life (long-term group) at the same dose as previously
      prescribed. The protocol was modified in February 1997, limiting tamoxifen
      treatment to 10 years after randomization, thus giving a comparison between a 2- 
      to 3-year treatment and a 12- to 13-year treatment. To date, the median duration 
      of tamoxifen treatment is 30 months in the short-term group, and 70 months in the
      long-term group. RESULTS: Overall, longer tamoxifen treatment induced a 23%
      reduction in relapse rates, leading to a 7-year disease-free survival rate of
      78%, compared with 72% in the shorter-treatment group. In contrast, overall
      survival did not differ between the two groups, with a 79% overall survival rate 
      in both groups. This improvement in disease-free survival could be observed in
      node-positive patients (P: =.001); however, it was not found in node-negative
      patients. Prolonged tamoxifen treatment corresponded to a significant increase in
      disease-free survival in estrogen receptor-positive patients (P: =.03) as well as
      in estrogen receptor-negative patients (P: =.05). Furthermore, longer treatment
      reduced contralateral breast cancers and did not increase the number of
      endometrial cancers. CONCLUSION: Although no survival advantage was noted,
      patients did benefit from longer tamoxifen treatment over 3 years and had
      significantly better disease-free survival compared with patients who stopped
      hormonal treatment. Long-term follow-up is needed to assess these results. Most
      patients in the long-term group are still receiving treatment. Comparison of
      results as time passes will enable conclusions to be made on the value of
      long-term treatment over 5 years compared with 2 to 3 years.

      pneumococcal polysaccharide and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children and
      young adults with sickle cell disease.
PG  - 1162-6
AB  - Children with sickle cell disease were immunized with either 2 doses of 7-valent 
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by 1 dose of 23-valent pneumococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine or a single dose of 23-valent vaccine. Functional
      antibodies to 7 vaccine serotypes were measured by a flow cytometric
      opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) and compared with IgG anticapsular polysaccharide
      antibody concentrations measured by ELISA. Moderate correlations were found
      between OPA and ELISA antibody titers for all 7 serotypes (r values, 0.41-0.70;
      P<.001 for all serotypes). After immunization with 23-valent vaccine, geometric
      mean antibody titers by OPA were significantly higher in the combined schedule
      group for 5 of 7 vaccine serotypes but were significantly higher for only 2 of 7 
      serotypes as measured by ELISA. The ability of OPA to show a greater differential
      response to the 2 immunization schedules used in this study suggests that it may 
      be useful in the evaluation of immunization regimens involving pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccines.

TI  - Are antibiotics necessary in the treatment of locally infected ingrown toenails?
PG  - 930-2
AB  - CONTEXT: A wide variety of generalists and specialists treat locally infected
      ingrown toenails, with perhaps the most common treatment regimen including
      resection of the nail border coupled with oral antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine whether oral antibiotic therapy is beneficial as an adjunct to the
      phenol chemical matrixectomy in the treatment of infected ingrown toenails.
      DESIGN: We prospectively enrolled healthy patients with infected ingrown
      toenails. Each patient was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups that received
      either 1 week of antibiotics and a chemical matrixectomy simultaneously (group
      1), antibiotics for 1 week and then a matrixectomy (group 2), or a matrixectomy
      alone (group 3). SETTING: Institutional ambulatory outpatient clinic. PATIENTS:
      Fifty-four healthy patients with infected ingrown toenails were studied. Patients
      with immunocompromised states, peripheral vascular disease, or cellulitis
      proximal to the hallux interphalangeal joint were excluded. Groups were age
      matched for comparison. RESULTS: Mean healing times for groups 1, 2, and 3 were
      1.9, 2.3, and 2.0 weeks, respectively. Subjects receiving antibiotics and a
      simultaneous chemical matrixectomy (group 1) healed significantly sooner than
      those receiving a 1-week course of antibiotics followed by a matrixectomy (group 
      2). There was not a significant difference in healing time between those that
      received a chemical matrixectomy alone (group 3) and those that received a
      matrixectomy coupled with a course of oral antibiotics (group 1). CONCLUSION: The
      use of oral antibiotics as an adjunctive therapy in treating ingrown toenails
      does not play a role in decreasing the healing time or postprocedure morbidity.

TI  - The effect of immersion on haemodynamic and fetal measures in uncomplicated
      pregnancies of nulliparous women.
PG  - 663-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of immersion in water on maternal haemodynamic 
      measures and fetal heart rate patterns in healthy nulliparous women. DESIGN: A
      randomised cross-over study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty pregnant women were studied
      between 26-29 weeks and between 34-37 weeks of gestation. METHODS: The women were
      either immersed in water for 35 minutes or rested on a bed for a similar period
      of time. Maternal blood pressure, thoracic electrical bioimpedance, urine and
      blood samples, and fetal heart rate patterns were obtained before and after
      immersion or bedrest. RESULTS: Compared with bedrest and pre-immersion values,
      immersion resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure, which returned to
      baseline values within 1.5 hour. Urine production increased for a short period
      after immersion, but 24 hour samples showed no difference compared with bedrest. 
      Sodium, potassium and creatinine levels in urine remained constant. No
      significant changes were found for the other haemodynamic measures. There were no
      effects on fetal heart rate nor on its variation. CONCLUSION: In healthy pregnant
      women immersion for 35 minutes has a clear effect on blood pressure and urine
      production. However, these effects are short lasting.

TI  - Comparison of extended versus brief treatments for marijuana use.
PG  - 898-908
AB  - Adult marijuana users (N = 291) seeking treatment were randomly assigned to an
      extended 14-session cognitive-behavioral group treatment (relapse prevention
      support group; RPSG), a brief 2-session individual treatment using motivational
      interviewing (individualized assessment and intervention; IAI), or a 4-month
      delayed treatment control (DTC) condition. Results indicated that marijuana use, 
      dependence symptoms, and negative consequences were reduced significantly in
      relation to pretreatment levels at 1-, 4-, 7-, 13-, and 16-month follow-ups.
      Participants in the RPSG and IAI treatments showed significantly and
      substantially greater improvement than DTC participants at the 4-month follow-up.
      There were no significant differences between RPSG and IAI outcomes at any
      follow-up. The relative efficacy of brief versus extended interventions for
      chronic marijuana-using adults is discussed.

TI  - Influence of botulinum toxin site of injections on healing rate in patients with 
      chronic anal fissure.
PG  - 46-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Botulinum toxin induces healing in patients with idiopathic anal
      fissure. METHODS: Fifty patients affected by posterior anal fissure were treated 
      with 20 units of botulinum toxin, injection in the internal anal sphincter on
      each side of the posterior midline (group I) or on each side of the anterior
      midline (group II). RESULTS: At 2 months evaluation, a healing scar was observed 
      in 15 patients of group I and in 22 patients of group II(P = 0.025). Resting anal
      pressure was significantly different from the baseline values at 1-month as well 
      as at 2-month check-ups in both groups, but the values were significantly lower
      in patients of group II. CONCLUSIONS: The intersite comparison revealed that
      anterior injection of the internal anal sphincter resulted in improved lowering
      of resting anal pressure and produced an earlier healing scar.

TI  - A randomized trial of in-home visits for disability prevention in
      community-dwelling older people at low and high risk for nursing home admission.
PG  - 977-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: In-home preventive visits with multidimensional geriatric assessments
      can delay the onset of disabilities in older people. METHODS: This was a
      stratified randomized trial. There were 791 participants, community-dwelling
      people in Bern, Switzerland, older than 75 years. The participants' risk status
      was based on 6 baseline predictors of functional deterioration. The intervention 
      consisted of annual multidimensional assessments and quarterly follow-up in-home 
      visits by 3 public health nurses (nurses A, B, and C), who, in collaboration with
      geriatricians, evaluated problems, gave recommendations, facilitated adherence
      with recommendations, and provided health education. Each nurse was responsible
      for conducting the home visits in 1 ZIP code area. RESULTS: After 3 years,
      surviving participants at low baseline risk in the intervention group were less
      dependent in instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) compared with controls
      (odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.0; P = .04). Among subjects at
      high baseline risk, there were no favorable intervention effects on ADL and an
      unfavorable increase in nursing home admissions (P= .02). Despite the similar
      health status of subjects, nurse C identified fewer problems in the subjects who 
      were visited compared with those assessed by nurses A and B. Subgroup analysis
      revealed that among low-risk subjects visited by nurses A and B, the intervention
      had favorable effects on instrumental ADL (P = .005) and basic ADL (P = .009),
      reduced nursing home admissions (P = .004), and resulted in net cost savings in
      the third year (US $1403 per person per year). Among low-risk subjects visited by
      nurse C, the intervention had no favorable effects. CONCLUSIONS: These data
      suggest that this intervention can reduce disabilities among elderly people at
      low risk but not among those at high risk for functional impairment, and that
      these effects are likely related to the home visitor's performance in conducting 
      the visits.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of community based speech and language therapy in
      preschool children.
PG  - 923-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare routine speech and language therapy in preschool children
      with delayed speech and language against 12 months of "watchful waiting." DESIGN:
      Pragmatic randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 16 community clinics in Bristol. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 159 preschool children with appreciable speech or language
      difficulties who fulfilled criteria for admission to speech and language therapy.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four quantitative measures of speech and language,
      assessed at 6 and 12 months; a binary variable indicating improvement, by 12
      months, on the trial entry criterion. RESULTS: Improvement in auditory
      comprehension was significant in favour of therapy (adjusted difference in means 
      4.1, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 7.6; P=0.025). No significant differences
      were observed for expressive language (1.4, -2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44); phonology error
      rate (-4.4, -12.0 to 3.3; P=0.26); language development (0.1, -0.4 to 0.6;
      P=0.73); or improvement on entry criterion (odds ratio 1.3, 0.67 to 2.4; P=0.46).
      At the end of the trial, 70% of all children still had substantial speech and
      language deficits. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides little evidence for the
      effectiveness of speech and language therapy compared with watchful waiting over 
      12 months. Providers of speech and language therapy should reconsider the
      appropriateness, timing, nature, and intensity of such therapy in preschool
      children. Continued research into more specific provision to subgroups of
      children is also needed to identify better treatment methods. The lack of
      resolution of difficulties for most of the children suggests that further
      research is needed to identify effective ways of helping this population of
      children.

PG  - 366-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of continuous combined treatment with
      norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (E2) on vaginal bleeding, spotting,
      or bleeding and/or spotting in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Two randomized
      clinical trials were conducted in which participants recorded information on the 
      daily occurrence of vaginal bleeding or spotting. In study 1, 219 postmenopausal 
      women reporting at least ten hot flushes per week were randomized to placebo or
      one of four treatment groups (0.2 mg norethindrone acetate/1 microg ethinyl E2,
      0.5 mg norethindrone acetate/2.5 microg ethinyl E2, 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 
      microg ethinyl E2, or 1 mg norethindrone acetate/10 microg ethinyl E2). In study 
      2, 266 postmenopausal women reporting at least 56 moderate to severe hot flushes 
      were randomized to placebo or one of three treatment groups (0.5 mg norethindrone
      acetate/2.5 microg ethinyl E2, 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl E2, or
      1 mg norethindrone acetate/10 microg ethinyl E2). The total duration of treatment
      was 16 weeks in study 1 and 12 weeks in study 2. In both studies, subjects
      reported in daily diaries whether they had either bleeding or spotting. RESULTS: 
      In study 1, there was a significantly greater relative risk (RR) for bleeding in 
      the group receiving 1 mg norethindrone acetate/10 microg ethinyl E2 at study
      weeks 4 and 8 (RR = 1.36 and 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01, 1.83; RR = 1.37
      and 95% CI 1.1, 1.72; respectively) compared with placebo, but not at study weeks
      12 or 16. The group receiving 1 mg norethindrone acetate/5 microg ethinyl E2 also
      had a significantly greater risk at weeks 4 and 8 (RR = 1.5 and 95% CI 1.15,
      1.96; RR = 1.33 and 95% CI 1.00, 1.77; respectively), whereas the other dose
      combinations did not differ from placebo. Results from study 2 were similar to
      those of study 1. CONCLUSION: Although there was a greater risk for bleeding
      and/or spotting at the higher doses of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl E2, this
      risk declined over time. If compliance with hormone replacement therapy regimens 
      is influenced at least in part by vaginal bleeding, the combined norethindrone
      acetate/ethinyl E2 regimen investigated in these studies may provide a treatment 
      option.

TI  - Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial of the effect of botulinum toxin
      on walking in cerebral palsy.
PG  - 481-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy is the commonest cause of severe physical disability
      in childhood. For many years treatment has centred on the use of physiotherapy
      and orthotics to overcome the problems of leg spasticity, which interferes with
      walking and can lead to limb deformity. Intramuscular botulinum toxin (BT-A)
      offers a targeted form of therapy to reduce spasticity in specific muscle groups.
      AIMS: To determine whether intramuscular BT-A can improve walking in children
      with cerebral palsy. DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. 
      METHODS: Forty patients with spastic diplegia or hemiplegia were enrolled. Twenty
      two received botulinum toxin and 18 received placebo. The primary outcome measure
      was video gait analysis and secondary outcome measures were gross motor function 
      measure (GMFM), physiological cost index (PCI), and passive ankle dorsiflexion.
      RESULTS: Video gait analysis showed clinically and statistically significant
      improvement in initial foot contact following BT-A at six weeks and 12 weeks
      compared to placebo. Forty eight per cent of BT-A treated children showed
      clinical improvement in VGA compared to 17% of placebo treated children. The GMFM
      (walking dimension) showed a statistically significant improvement in favour of
      the botulinum toxin treated group. Changes in PCI and passive ankle dorsiflexion 
      were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The study gives further support
      to the use of intramuscular botulinum toxin type A as an adjunct to conventional 
      physiotherapy and orthoses to reduce spasticity and improve functional mobility
      in children with spastic diplegic or hemiplegic cerebral palsy.

TI  - Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis. VIGOR Study Group.
PG  - 1520-8, 2 p following 1528
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4
      percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically
      important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen
      among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We randomly assigned 8076
      patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and
      receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to
      receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The
      primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events
      (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
      symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers). RESULTS: Rofecoxib and naproxen had similar
      efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months,
      2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with
      rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative
      risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective
      rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100
      patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8;
      P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the 
      naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4
      percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the
      overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were
      similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
      treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is
      associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal
      events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.

TI  - Bronchoprotection with a leukotriene receptor antagonist in asthmatic preschool
      children.
PG  - 187-90
AB  - We hypothesized that a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) could provide
      bronchoprotection against the cold, dry air-induced response in asthmatic
      preschool children. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
      study, we examined the effect of the specific LTRA montelukast at 5 mg/d for 2 d 
      on the bronchoconstriction induced by hyperventilation of cold, dry air in 13
      asthmatic children 3 to 5 yr old. The bronchoconstriction was measured as the
      specific airway resistance (sRaw) in a whole-body plethysmograph before and 4 min
      after challenge with cold, dry air. The repeatability of the bronchoprotection
      was examined by repeating the placebo-controlled study in six of the 13 children.
      sRaw increased by an average of 46% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30 to 63%)
      after placebo treatment and 17% (95% CI: 3 to 31%) after montelukast (p < 0.01). 
      Eight of the children were receiving regular treatment with budesonide delivered 
      by an inhaler with a spacer in a mean daily dose of 350 microg, but the
      bronchoprotection provided by montelukast was independent of concurrent steroid
      treatment. There was no convincing evidence of failure to respond, and the
      protective effect of montelukast was consistent upon repeated testing (p = 0.
      02). We conclude that the LTRA montelukast provided clinically significant
      bronchoprotection against the effect of hyperventilation of cold dry air in
      asthmatic children 3 to 5 yr old. The bronchoprotection appeared to be
      homogeneous among the children, and seemed independent of steroid treatment. This
      suggests that LTRAs may be of therapeutic use in limiting clinical symptoms of
      asthma in young children.

TI  - Incentive spirometry does not enhance recovery after thoracic surgery.
PG  - 679-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the additional effect of incentive spirometry to chest 
      physiotherapy to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications after thoracic
      surgery for lung and esophageal resections. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. 
      SETTING: University hospital, intensive care unit, and surgical department.
      PATIENTS: Sixty-seven patients (age, 59 +/- 13 yrs; forced expiratory volume in 1
      sec, 93% +/- 22% predicted) undergoing elective thoracic surgery for lung (n =
      40) or esophagus (n = 27) resection. INTERVENTIONS: Physiotherapy (breathing
      exercises, huffing, and coughing) (PT) plus incentive spirometry (IS) was
      compared with PT alone. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lung function, body
      temperature, chest radiograph, white blood cell count, and number of hospital and
      intensive care unit days were all measured. Pulmonary function was significantly 
      reduced after surgery (55% of the initial value) and improved significantly in
      the postoperative period in both groups. However, no differences were observed in
      the recovery of pulmonary function between the groups. The overall score of the
      chest radiograph, based on the presence of atelectasis, was similar in both
      treatment groups. Eight patients (12%) (three patients with lobectomy and five
      with esophagus resection) developed a pulmonary complication (abnormal chest
      radiograph, elevated body temperature and white blood cell count), four in each
      treatment group. Adding IS to regular PT did not reduce hospital or intensive
      care unit stay. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary complications after lung and esophagus
      surgery were relatively low. The addition of IS to PT did not further reduce
      pulmonary complications or hospital stay. Although we cannot rule out beneficial 
      effects in a subgroup of high-risk patients, routine use of IS after thoracic
      surgery seems to be ineffective.

TI  - Nitroglycerin application during cesarean delivery: plasma levels, fetal/maternal
      ratio of nitroglycerin, and effects in newborns.
PG  - 955-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate maternal and fetal nitroglycerin
      metabolization and to assess the clinical condition of neonates after intravenous
      nitroglycerin application during cesarean delivery. STUDY DESIGN: At the time of 
      the uterine puncture incision, either 0. 25 mg or 0.5 mg nitroglycerin or a
      physiologic sodium chloride solution was administered as an intravenous bolus.
      Plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin and its metabolites were measured in
      maternal venous blood and in umbilical blood samples taken immediately after cord
      clamping. Arterial blood pressure, pulse rates, and Apgar scores were recorded
      for the neonates 1, 5, and 10 minutes after birth. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients
      were included in the pharmacokinetic study. Median maternal plasma levels 1 and 5
      minutes after injection of 0.5 mg nitroglycerin were 80 and 3.2 ng/mL,
      respectively; median maternal plasma levels 1 and 5 minutes after injection of
      0.25 mg nitroglycerin were 38 and 1.2 ng/mL, respectively. In the umbilical vein 
      1 minute after application of 0. 5 mg or 0.25 mg nitroglycerin, the plasma levels
      were 0.41 and 0.09 ng/mL, respectively, and in the umbilical artery they were
      0.03 and 0.008 ng/mL, respectively. Circulatory parameters and Apgar scores in
      the neonates did not differ significantly from those found in the placebo group. 
      CONCLUSION: The level of nitroglycerin in umbilical plasma was two to three
      orders of magnitude lower than that found in maternal plasma and clearly in a
      subtherapeutic range. There was no indication that prenatal application of
      nitroglycerin to facilitate obstetric management is hazardous for neonates.

TI  - Prospective randomized comparison of antiarrhythmic therapy versus first-line
      radiofrequency ablation in patients with atrial flutter.
PG  - 1898-904
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the high success rate of radiofrequency (RF) ablation,
      pharmacologic therapy is still considered the standard initial therapeutic
      approach for atrial flutter. OBJECTIVE: We prospectively compared the outcome at 
      follow-up of patients with atrial flutter randomly assigned to drug therapy or RF
      ablation. METHODS: Patients with at least two episodes of symptomatic atrial
      flutter in the last four months were randomized to regimens of either
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy or first-line RF ablation. After institution of
      therapy, end points included recurrence of atrial flutter, rehospitalization and 
      quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients entered the study, 30 of whom
      were randomized to drug therapy and 31 to RF ablation. After a mean follow-up of 
      21 +/- 11 months, 11 of 30 (36%) patients receiving drugs were in sinus rhythm,
      versus 25 of 31 (80%) patients who underwent RF ablation (p < 0.01). Of the
      patients receiving drugs, 63% required one or more rehospitalizations, whereas
      post-RF ablation, only 22% of patients were rehospitalized (p < 0.01). Following 
      RF ablation, 29% of patients developed atrial fibrillation which was seen in 53% 
      of patients receiving medications (p < 0.05). Sense of well being (pre-RF 2.0 +/-
      0.3 vs. post-RF 3.8 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01) and function in daily life (pre-RF 2.3 +/-
      0.4 vs. post-RF 3.6 +/- 0.6, p < 0.01) improved after ablation, but did not
      change significantly in patients treated with drugs. CONCLUSION: In a selected
      group of patients with atrial flutter, RF ablation could be considered a
      first-line therapy due to the better success rate and impact on quality of life, 
      the lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation and the lower need for
      rehospitalization at follow-up.

TI  - Extended-release niacin vs gemfibrozil for the treatment of low levels of
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Niaspan-Gemfibrozil Study Group.
PG  - 1177-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a direct comparison of agents that raise plasma levels of
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to help devise strategies for
      coronary risk reduction. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind
      trial, we compared the effects of extended-release niacin (Niaspan), at doses
      increased sequentially from 1000 to 2000 mg at bedtime, with those of
      gemfibrozil, 600 mg given twice daily, in raising low levels of HDL-C. Enrollment
      criteria included an HDL-C level of 1.03 mmol/L or less (< or =40 mg/dL), a
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 4.14 mmol/L or less (< or =160
      mg/dL) or less than 3.36 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) with atherosclerotic disease, and a 
      triglyceride level of 4.52 mmol/L or less (< or =400 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 173
      patients, 72 (82%) of the 88 assigned to Niaspan treatment and 68 (80%) of the 85
      assigned to gemfibrozil treatment completed the study. Niaspan, at 1500 and 2000 
      mg, vs gemfibrozil raised the HDL-C level more (21% and 26%, respectively, vs
      13%), raised the apolipoprotein A-I level more (9% and 11% vs 4%), reduced the
      total cholesterol-HDL-C ratio more (-17% and -22% vs -12%), reduced the
      lipoprotein(a) level (-7% and -20% vs no change), and had no adverse effect on
      the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (2% and 0% change vs a 9%
      increase). Significance levels for comparisons between medications ranged from
      P<.001 to P<.02. Gemfibrozil reduced the triglyceride level more than Niaspan
      (P<.001 to P = .06, -40% for gemfibrozil vs -16% to -29% for Niaspan, 1000 to
      2000 mg). Effects on plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly favorable for
      Niaspan compared with gemfibrozil (P<.02), as gemfibrozil increased the
      fibrinogen level (from 5% to 9%) and Niaspan tended to decrease the fibrinogen
      level (from -1% to -6%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a low baseline HDL-C
      level, Niaspan at its higher doses provided up to 2-fold greater HDL-C increases,
      decreases in lipoprotein(a), improvements in lipoprotein cholesterol ratios, and 
      lower fibrinogen levels compared with gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil gave a greater
      triglyceride reduction but also increased the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      level, which did not occur with Niaspan.

TI  - The effects of transdermal estradiol on the response to mental stress in
      postmenopausal women: a randomized trial.
PG  - 463-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Estrogens inhibit adrenomedullary catecholamine release and
      catecholamine-mediated responses to stress. We examined whether estrogen
      supplementation reduces the sympathoadrenal response to mental stress in
      postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the effects of 3-week
      treatment with transdermal 17-beta-estradiol and placebo in 10 postmenopausal
      women using a randomized, blinded, crossover design. We measured plasma
      catecholamine levels and the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to a
      15-minute stress with mental arithmetic. Treatments were compared using repeated 
      measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: During placebo treatment, mean (+/- SD)
      epinephrine levels reached a peak of 431 +/- 135 pmol/liter after 15 minutes of
      stress; the epinephrine response was blunted during estradiol treatment, with a
      peak of 357 +/- 77 pmol/liter (P <0.05). Estradiol also blunted the diastolic
      blood pressure response to stress (baseline levels of 78 +/- 15 mm Hg vs peak of 
      90 +/- 6 mm Hg during placebo; baseline of 80 +/- 8 mm Hg vs peak of 84 +/- 6 mm 
      Hg during estradiol; P <0.05). Estradiol treatment also blunted the decrease in
      the standard deviation of the mean of the electrocardiographic RR intervals and
      the increase in the ratio between the low-frequency and high-frequency
      bandwidths. CONCLUSION: We observed a moderate, although significant, reduction
      in markers of the stress response to mental arithmetic in postmenopausal women
      treated with transdermal 17-beta-estradiol.

TI  - American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L) reduces postprandial glycemia in
      nondiabetic subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a lack of medical evidence to support its therapeutic
      efficacy, the use of herbal medicine has increased considerably. Ginseng, one of 
      the most widely used herbs, is hypothesized to play a role in carbohydrate
      metabolism and diabetes mellitus. We therefore undertook a preliminary short-term
      clinical study to assess whether American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L) affects
      postprandial glycemia in humans. DESIGN: On 4 separate occasions, 10 nondiabetic 
      subjects (mean [+/-SD] age, 34+/-7 years; mean [+/-SD] body mass index [BMI],
      25.6 +/- 3 kg/m2) and 9 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean [+/-SD] age,
      62 +/- 7 years; mean [+/-SD] BMI, 29 +/- 5 kg/m2; mean [+/-SD] glycosylated
      hemoglobin A1c, 0.08+/-0.005) were randomized to receive 3-g ginseng or placebo
      capsules, either 40 minutes before or together with a 25-g oral glucose
      challenge. The placebo capsules contained com flour, in which the quantity of
      carbohydrate and appearance matched the ginseng capsules. A capillary blood
      sample was taken fasting and then at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 (only for
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus ) minutes after the glucose challenge.
      RESULTS: In nondiabetic subjects, no differences were found in postprandial
      glycemia between placebo and ginseng when administered together with the glucose 
      challenge. When ginseng was taken 40 minutes before the glucose challenge,
      significant reductions were observed (P<.05). In subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, the same was true whether capsules were taken before or together with
      the glucose challenge (P<.05). Reductions in area under the glycemic curve were
      18%+/-31% for nondiabetic subjects and 19+/-22% and 22+/-17% for subjects with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus administered before or together with the glucose
      challenge, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: American ginseng attenuated postprandial
      glycemia in both study groups. For nondiabetic subjects, to prevent unintended
      hypoglycemia it may be important that the American ginseng be taken with the
      meal.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic versus open fundoplication: blind
      evaluation of recovery and discharge period.
PG  - 873-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a widespread belief that introduction of the laparoscopic
      technique in antireflux surgery has led to easier postoperative recovery. To test
      this hypothesis a prospective randomized clinical trial with blind evaluation was
      conducted between laparoscopic and open fundoplication. METHODS: Sixty patients
      with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were randomized to open or laparoscopic
      360 degrees fundoplication. The type of operation was unknown to the patient and 
      the evaluating nurses after operation. RESULTS: The operating time was longer in 
      the laparoscopy group, median 148 versus 109 min (P < 0.0001). The need for
      analgesics was less in the laparoscopically operated patients, 33.9 versus 67.5
      mg morphine per total hospital stay (P < 0.001). There was no significant
      difference in postoperative nausea and vomiting. On the first day after operation
      patients in the laparoscopy group had better respiratory function: forced vital
      capacity 3.2 versus 2. 2 litres (P = 0.004) and forced expiratory volume 2.6
      versus 2.0 litres (P = 0.008). Postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the
      laparoscopic group, median (range) 3 (2-6) versus 3 (2-10) days (P = 0.021). No
      difference was found in the duration of sick leave. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic
      fundoplication was associated with a longer operating time, better respiratory
      function, less need for analgesics and a shorter hospital stay, while no
      reduction in the duration of postoperative sick leave was found compared with
      open surgery.

TI  - Prevention of infection in multiple trauma patients by high-dose intravenous
      immunoglobulins.
PG  - 8-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the activity of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a 
      prophylactic agent against infection in trauma victims. DESIGN: Prospective,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: A 20-bed university 
      intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Thirty-nine trauma patients with injury severity
      scores (ISSs) of 16-50. INTERVENTIONS: Penicillin was given at the time of
      admission and continued at least until day 4. Twenty-one patients received IVIG
      and 18 patients received human albumin at 1 g/kg in four divided doses (days 1,
      2, 3, and 6). The two groups had similarities in age, gender, Acute Physiology
      and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, risk of death, and Glasgow Coma Scale
      score, but differing ISSs (p = .02), at the time of admission. Blood was
      collected on days 1, 4, and 7. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical variables 
      related to infection were recorded. The complement components C3c, C4 and CH50,
      IgG, and the fractions of IgG were measured. The serum bactericidal activity
      (SBA) was assessed at 37 degrees C (98.6 degrees F) and 40 degrees C (104.0
      degrees F) at the time of admission and during the course of IVIG administration.
      Controlling for ISS, IVIG-treated patients had fewer pneumonias (p = .003) and
      total non-catheter-related infections (p = .04). Catheter-related infections (p =
      .76), length of stay in the intensive care unit, antibiotic days, and
      infection-related mortality did not differ between the two groups. A
      significantly increased trend in IgG and its subclasses was shown on days 4 and 7
      in the IVIG group but not in the control group (p<.000001). No important
      differences were noted in complement fractions. The SBA of the groups was similar
      on day 1, but significantly higher on days 4 and 7 (p<.000001) in the IVIG group,
      remaining so controlling for complement and ISS. SBA was higher at 40 degrees C
      (104.0 degrees F) compared with 37 degrees C (98.6 degrees F) (p<.0001) under all
      three conditions. In both groups, low SBA (on days 1, 4, and 7) was associated
      with increased risk of pneumonia (p<.01) and non-catheter-related infections (p =
      .06 for day 1; p<.01 for days 4 and 7). CONCLUSIONS: Trauma patients receiving
      high doses of IVIG exhibit a reduction of septic complications and an improvement
      of SBA. Early SBA measurement may represent an index of susceptibility to
      infection.

TI  - Oral insulin administration and residual beta-cell function in recent-onset type 
      1 diabetes: a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Diabete Insuline Orale
      group.
PG  - 545-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral administration of autoantigens can slow the progression of
      beta-cell destruction in non-obese diabetic mice. We investigated whether oral
      administration of recombinant human insulin could protect residual beta-cell
      function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We enrolled 131
      autoantibody-positive diabetic patients aged 7-40 years within 2 weeks of
      diagnosis (no ketoacidosis at diagnosis, weight loss <10%, polyuria for <6
      weeks). They were randomly assigned 2.5 mg or 7.5 mg oral insulin daily or
      placebo for 1 year, in addition to subcutaneous insulin therapy. Serum C-peptide 
      concentrations were measured in the fasting state and after stimulation, to
      assess beta-cell function. Autoantibodies to beta-cell antigens were assayed.
      Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Baseline C-peptide and haemoglobin
      A1c concentrations were similar in the three groups. During follow-up, there were
      no differences between the groups assigned 2.5 mg or 7.5 mg oral insulin or
      placebo in subcutaneous insulin requirements, haemoglobin A1c concentrations, or 
      measurements of fasting (mean at 12 months 0.18 [SD 0.17], 0.17 [0.17], and 0.17 
      [0.12] nmol/L) or stimulated C-peptide concentrations (glucagon-stimulated 0.39
      [0.38], 0.37 [0.39], and 0.33 [0.24] nmol/L; meal-stimulated 0.72 [0.60], 0.49
      [0.49], and 0.57 [0.51 nmol/L]. Neither age nor C-peptide concentration at entry 
      influenced treatment effects. No differences were seen in the time-course or
      titres of antibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, or islet antigen 2.
      INTERPRETATION: At the doses used in this trial, oral administration of insulin
      initiated at clinical onset of type 1 diabetes did not prevent the deterioration 
      of beta-cell function.

TI  - Naltrexone's effects on reactivity to alcohol cues among alcoholic men.
PG  - 738-42
AB  - The mechanisms of naltrexone's effects on urges to drink during abstinence are
      unclear. Naltrexone may suppress either urges to drink specifically or appetitive
      responses in general. The effects of naltrexone on cue reactivity to alcoholic
      and sweet nonalcoholic beverages were investigated. Alcohol-dependent men (N =
      53) in treatment received naltrexone (50 mg) or placebo. Four hours later, they
      received baseline assessment, exposure to fruit juice, and exposure to their
      usual alcoholic beverage in 3-min trials. Naltrexone reduced urge to drink and
      self-reported attention to the alcohol cues, not at the initial exposure but
      after repeated exposures to alcohol cues. Naltrexone reduced negative affect
      across baseline and alcohol trials. No effects of naltrexone on responses to the 
      nonalcoholic appetitive beverage cues were found, suggesting that general
      appetite suppression does not mediate the effects of naltrexone on urges.

TI  - Effect of inhaled triamcinolone on the decline in pulmonary function in chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 1902-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results from a
      progressive decline in lung function, which is thought to be the consequence of
      airway inflammation. We hypothesized that antiinflammatory therapy with inhaled
      corticosteroids would slow this decline. METHODS: We enrolled 1116 persons with
      COPD whose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 30 to 90 percent of 
      the predicted value in a 10-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of
      inhaled triamcinolone acetonide administered at a dose of 600 microg twice daily.
      The primary outcome measure was the rate of decline in FEV1 after the
      administration of a bronchodilator. The secondary outcome measures included
      respiratory symptoms, use of health care services, and airway reactivity. In a
      substudy of 412 participants, we measured bone density in the lumbar spine and
      femur at base line and one and three years after the beginning of treatment.
      RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 40 months. The rate of decline in the
      FEV1 after bronchodilator use was similar in the 559 participants in the
      triamcinolone group and the 557 participants in the placebo group (44.2+/-2.9 vs.
      47.0+/-3.0 ml per year, P= 0.50). Members of the triamcinolone group had fewer
      respiratory symptoms during the course of the study (21.1 per 100 person-years
      vs. 28.2 per 100 person-years, P=0.005) and had fewer visits to a physician
      because of a respiratory illness (1.2 per 100 person-years vs. 2.1 per 100
      person-years, P=0.03). Those taking triamcinolone also had lower airway
      reactivity in response to methacholine challenge at 9 months and 33 months
      (P=0.02 for both comparisons). After three years, the bone density of the lumbar 
      spine and the femur was significantly lower in the triamcinolone group (P < or = 
      0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled triamcinolone does not slow the rate of decline in
      lung function in people with COPD, but it improves airway reactivity and
      respiratory symptoms and decreases the use of health care services for
      respiratory problems. These benefits should be weighed against the potential
      long-term adverse effects of triamcinolone on bone mineral density.

TI  - A randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the role of salmeterol in the 
      in-hospital management of asthma.
PG  - 313-20
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of salmeterol xinafoate as an
      adjunct to conventional therapy for the in-hospital management of acute asthma.
      DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.
      SETTING: Medical wards of a large university-based hospital. PATIENTS:
      Forty-three patients admitted for an acute exacerbation of asthma. INTERVENTIONS:
      Salmeterol (42 microg) or two puffs of placebo every 12 h in addition to standard
      therapy (short-acting beta-agonists, corticosteroids, and anticholinergic
      agents). RESULTS: No clinically adverse effects were seen with the addition of
      salmeterol to conventional therapy. After salmeterol, there was no difference in 
      pulse, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, severity of
      symptoms, or dyspnea score. Patients receiving salmeterol had greater FEV(1)
      percent improvements than the placebo group at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. These
      findings were not statistically significant. By paired Student's t tests, there
      were significant improvements in FEV(1) (p = 0.03) and FVC (p = 0.03) in the
      salmeterol group after 48 h of treatment with no comparable improvement in the
      placebo group. In a subgroup analysis of patients with an initial FEV(1) < or =
      1.5 L, the absolute FEV(1) percent improvement for salmeterol vs placebo was 51% 
      vs 16% at 24 h and 54% vs 40% at 48 h. The relative FEV(1) percent improvement
      for salmeterol vs placebo was 17% vs 8% at 24 h and 18% vs 14% at 48 h.
      CONCLUSION: The addition of salmeterol to conventional therapy is safe and may
      benefit hospitalized patients with asthma. Further studies are needed to clarify 
      its role in the treatment of acute exacerbation of asthma.

TI  - A randomised controlled pilot study of the management of gestational impaired
      glucose tolerance.
PG  - 959-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a study of a less intensive form of management
      for impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy is feasible and whether women would
      accept randomisation. DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled study. SETTING: A
      large district general hospital and a large teaching hospital in West Yorkshire. 
      SAMPLE: Seventy women with impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy. METHODS: One 
      group monitored plasma glucose up to four times daily. The other group did not
      monitor plasma glucose at all. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of women
      recruited of those approached and neonatal admissions to special care baby units 
      in each group. RESULTS: Sixty-eight of 70 women approached entered the study.
      There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in
      neonatal outcome measures. The median number of plasma glucose measurements in
      the monitored group was 118 (range 0-500), and 19% of women in the monitored
      group were treated with insulin. CONCLUSIONS: This study fails to demonstrate any
      benefit from intensive management of impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy with
      additional maternal inconvenience. This pilot study has shown that a large
      randomised controlled study of the management of impaired glucose tolerance in
      pregnancy is not only feasible but necessary.

TI  - High-dose cyclophosphamide in severe aplastic anaemia: a randomised trial.
PG  - 1554-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: High-dose cyclophosphamide has been proposed as an alternative
      immunosuppressive agent for treatment of severe aplastic anaemia, with a response
      rate similar to that with regimens containing antithymocyte globulin (ATG) but
      neither relapse nor clonal haematological complications. We undertook a phase
      III, prospective, randomised trial to compare response rates to immunosuppression
      with either high-dose cyclophosphamide plus cyclosporin or conventional
      immunosuppression with ATG plus cyclosporin in previously untreated patients.
      METHODS: Between June, 1997, and March, 2000, 31 patients were enrolled. 15 were 
      assigned cyclophosphamide (1 h intravenous infusion of 50 mg/kg daily for 4 days)
      and 16 were assigned ATG (40 mg/kg daily for 4 days); both groups received
      cyclosporin, initially at 12 mg/kg daily with adjustment to maintain
      concentrations at 200-400 microg/L, for 6 months. The primary endpoint was
      haematological response (no longer meeting criteria for severe aplastic anaemia).
      The trial was terminated prematurely after three early deaths in the
      cyclophosphamide group. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Median
      follow-up was 21.9 months (range 1-33). There was excess morbidity in the
      cyclophosphamide group (invasive fungal infections, four cyclophosphamide vs no
      ATG patients; p=0.043) as well as excess early mortality (three deaths within the
      first 3 months cyclophosphamide vs no ATG patients; p=0.101). There was no
      significant difference at 6 months after treatment in the overall response rates 
      among evaluable patients (six of 13 [46%] cyclophosphamide vs nine of 12 [75%]
      ATG). INTERPRETATION: A longer period of observation will be necessary to assess 
      the secondary endpoints of relapse and late clonal complications as well as
      disease-free and overall survival. However, cyclophosphamide seems a dangerous
      choice for treatment of this disorder, given the good results achievable with
      standard therapy.

TI  - Coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients and their family member caregivers:
      outcomes of a family-focused staged psychoeducational intervention.
PG  - 142-50
AB  - This experimental study examined the effectiveness of a psychoeducational
      intervention delivered over 12 weeks. The sample was comprised of 38 coronary
      artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patient-family member caregiver dyads who
      completed all six data collection points. Experimental and control groups did not
      differ in emotional health, functional health status, or satisfaction.
      Differences in the number of self-reported complications/symptoms were not in the
      predicted direction. Improvement occurred in clinical, functional, and emotional 
      outcomes; however, several symptoms, such as fatigue and pain, persisted. Family 
      caregivers reported more depressive symptoms than patients preoperatively and at 
      later stages of recovery. Implications include the need for instruction about the
      recovery trajectory and adequate preparation and support of home health nurses
      and family caregivers.

TI  - Botulinum toxin (Dysport) treatment of hip adductor spasticity in multiple
      sclerosis: a prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, dose
      ranging study.
PG  - 707-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define a safe and effective dose of Dysport for treating hip
      adductor spasticity. METHODS: Patients with definite or probable multiple
      sclerosis, and disabling spasticity affecting the hip adductor muscles of both
      legs, were randomised to one of four treatment groups. Dysport (500, 1000, or
      1500 Units), or placebo was administered by intramuscular injection to these
      muscles. Patients were assessed at entry, and 2, 4 (primary analysis time-point),
      8, and 12 weeks post-treatment. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were recruited.
      Treatment groups were generally well matched at entry. The primary efficacy
      variables-passive hip abduction and distance between the knees-improved for all
      groups. The improvement in distance between the knees for the 1500 Unit group was
      significantly greater than placebo (p = 0.02). Spasm frequency was reduced in all
      groups, but muscle tone was reduced in the Dysport groups only. Pain was reduced 
      in all groups, but improvements in hygiene scores were evident only in the 1000
      Unit and 1500 Unit groups. Duration of benefit was significantly longer than
      placebo for all Dysport groups (p<0.05). Adverse events were reported by 32/58
      (55%) Dysport patients, and by 10/16 (63%) placebo patients. Compared with the
      two lower dose groups, twice as many adverse events were reported by the 1500
      Unit group (2.7/patient). The incidence of muscle weakness was higher for the
      1500 Unit group (36%) than for placebo (6%). The response to treatment was
      considered positive by two thirds of the patients in the 500 Unit group, and by
      about half the patients in the other groups. CONCLUSION: Dysport reduced the
      degree of hip adductor spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, and this
      benefit was evident despite the concomitant use of oral antispasticity medication
      and analgesics. Although evidence for a dose response effect was not
      statistically significant, there was a clear trend towards greater efficacy and
      duration of effect with higher doses of Dysport. Dysport treatment was well
      tolerated, with no major side effects seen at doses up to 1500 Units. The optimal
      dose for hip adductor spasticity seems to be 500-1000 Units, divided between both
      legs.

TI  - A multicenter, randomized trial of fluconazole versus amphotericin B for empiric 
      antifungal therapy of febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.
PG  - 282-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of fluconazole and amphotericin B as 
      empiric antifungal therapy of febrile neutropenic patients with cancer. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: A total of 317 neutropenic patients (<500 cells/mm3) with persistent
      or recrudescent fever despite 4 or more days of antibacterial therapy were
      randomly assigned to receive either fluconazole (400 mg intravenously once daily)
      or amphotericin B (0.5 mg/kg once daily). Patients were evaluated for the
      efficacy and safety of each drug by clinical criteria, frequent cultures and
      radiological procedures, and laboratory values. A response was classified as
      satisfactory at the end of therapy if the patient was afebrile, had no clinical
      or microbiological evidence of fungal infection, and did not require study
      termination due to lack of efficacy, drug toxicity, or death. RESULTS: A
      satisfactory response occurred in 68% of the patients treated with fluconazole
      (107 of 158 patients) and in 67% of patients treated with amphotericin B (106 of 
      159 patients). Progressive or new fungal infections during therapy occurred in 13
      (8%) patients treated with fluconazole (8 with Candida, 5 with Aspergillus) and
      in 10 (6%) patients treated with amphotericin B (5 with Candida, 3 with
      Aspergillus, 2 with other fungi). Adverse events related to study drug
      (especially fever, chills, renal insufficiency, electrolyte disturbances, and
      respiratory distress) occurred more often in patients treated with amphotericin B
      (128 [81%] of 159 patients) than patients treated with fluconazole (20 [13%] of
      158 patients, P = 0.001). Eleven (7%) patients treated with amphotericin B but
      only 1 (1%) patient treated with fluconazole were terminated from the study owing
      to an adverse event (P = 0.005). Overall mortality (27 [17%] patients treated
      with fluconazole versus 34 [21%] patients treated with amphotericin B) and
      mortality from fungal infection (7 [4%] patients treated with fluconazole versus 
      5 [3%] patients treated with amphotericin B) were similar in each study group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous fluconazole can be an effective and safe alternative to 
      amphotericin B for empiric antifungal therapy in many febrile neutropenic
      patients. However, because fluconazole may be ineffective in the treatment of
      Aspergillus, patients at risk for that infection should be evaluated by chest
      radiograph, computed tomographic scanning, and cultures before the use of empiric
      fluconazole therapy.

TI  - Rifampin and pyrazinamide vs isoniazid for prevention of tuberculosis in
      HIV-infected persons: an international randomized trial. Terry Beirn Community
      Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS, the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group, the
      Pan American Health Organization, and the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention Study Group.
PG  - 1445-50
AB  - CONTEXT: Because of problems with adherence, toxicity, and increasing resistance 
      associated with 6- to 12-month isoniazid regimens, an alternative short-course
      tuberculosis preventive regimen is needed. OBJECTIVE: To compare a 2-month
      regimen of daily rifampin and pyrazinamide with a 12-month regimen of daily
      isoniazid in preventing tuberculosis in persons with human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) infection. DESIGN: Randomized, open-label controlled trial conducted from
      September 1991 to May 1996, with follow-up through October 1997. SETTING:
      Outpatient clinics in the United States, Mexico, Haiti, and Brazil. PARTICIPANTS:
      A total of 1583 HIV-positive persons aged 13 years or older with a positive
      tuberculin skin test result. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to
      isoniazid, 300 mg/d, with pyridoxine hydrochloride for 12 months (n = 792) or
      rifampin, 600 mg/d, and pyrazinamide, 20 mg/kg per day, for 2 months (n = 791).
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was culture-confirmed tuberculosis; 
      secondary end points were proven or probable tuberculosis, adverse events, and
      death, compared by treatment group. RESULTS: Of patients assigned to rifampin and
      pyrazinamide, 80% completed the regimen compared with 69% assigned to isoniazid
      (P<.001). After a mean follow-up of 37 months, 19 patients (2.4%) assigned to
      rifampin and pyrazinamide and 26 (3.3%) assigned to isoniazid developed confirmed
      tuberculosis at rates of 0.8 and 1.1 per 100 person-years, respectively (risk
      ratio, 0.72 [95% confidence interval, 0.40-1.31]; P = .28). In multivariate
      analysis, there were no significant differences in rates for confirmed or
      probable tuberculosis (P = .83), HIV progression and/or death (P = .09), or
      overall adverse events (P = .27), although drug discontinuation was slightly
      higher in the rifampin and pyrazinamide group (P = .01). Neither regimen appeared
      to lead to the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      suggest that for preventing tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients, a daily
      2-month regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide is similar in safety and efficacy to
      a daily 12-month regimen of isoniazid. This shorter regimen offers practical
      advantages to both patients and tuberculosis control programs.

TI  - Usefulness of carvedilol in unstable angina pectoris.
PG  - 1173-8
AB  - The safety and efficacy of adding oral carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) to
      standardized treatment of unstable angina was assessed in a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial on 116 patients with acute
      unstable angina. Patients were monitored in an intensive care unit and underwent 
      48-hour Holter monitoring to assess transient ischemia. Carvedilol as adjunctive 
      therapy resulted in a significant reduction of median heart rate (65 vs 75
      beats/min, p <0.05), mean systolic blood pressure (133 vs 130 mm Hg, p <0.05),
      and mean rate-pressure product (8,337 vs 10,042, p <0.05). Carvedilol reduced the
      ischemic burden during 48 hours of treatment by 75% (49 vs 204 minutes),
      including a 36% reduction of patients with ischemic episodes (p <0.05), a 66%
      reduction of the mean number of ischemic episodes (8 vs 24, p <0.05), and a 76%
      reduction in the mean duration of ischemic episodes (50 vs 205 minutes, p <0.05).
      Side effects occurred in 8 of 59 patients (13.6%) in the carvedilol group and in 
      5 of 54 patients (8.8%) given placebo. Although not significant, the early onset 
      of maximal blood pressure reduction and the delayed effect on heart rate were
      closely correlated to drug-induced hypotension and bradycardia in the carvedilol 
      group. Thus, carvedilol as an adjunctive to standardized treatment effectively
      reduces heart rate and blood pressure, and thus the ischemic burden in patients
      with unstable angina pectoris, but requires close monitoring of patients at risk 
      for bradycardia or hypotension.

TI  - International randomised controlled trial of patient triggered ventilation in
      neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.
PG  - F5-F10
AB  - AIM: To compare the effects of patient triggered ventilation (PTV) with
      conventional ventilation (IMV) in preterm infants ventilated for respiratory
      distress syndrome (RDS). METHODS: Nine hundred and twenty four babies from 22
      neonatal intensive care units were assessed. They were under 32 weeks of
      gestation and had been ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) for
      less than 6 hours within 72 hours of birth. The infants were randomly allocated
      to receive either PTV or IMV. Analysis was on an "intention to treat" basis.
      Death before discharge home or oxygen therapy at 36 weeks of gestation;
      pneumothorax while ventilated; cerebral ultrasound abnormality nearest to 6
      weeks; and duration of ventilation in survivors were the main outcome measures.
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference in outcome between the two groups.
      Unadjusted rates for death or oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of gestation were
      47.4% and 48.7%, for PTV and IMV, respectively; for pneumothorax these were 13.4%
      and 10.3%; and for cerebral ultrasound abnormality nearest to 6 weeks these were 
      35.4% and 36.9%. Median duration of ventilation for survivors in both groups was 
      6 days. Overall, 79% of babies received only their assigned ventilation. PTV
      babies were more likely to depart from their intended ventilation (27% vs 15%).
      The trend towards higher pneumothorax rates with PTV occurred only in infants
      below 28 weeks of gestation (18.8% vs 11.8%). CONCLUSIONS: There was no observed 
      benefit from the use of PTV, with a trend towards a higher rate of pneumothorax
      under 28 weeks of gestation. Although PTV has a similar outcome to IMV for
      treatment of RDS in infants of 28 weeks or more gestation, within 72 hours of
      birth, it was abandoned more often. It cannot be recommended for infants of less 
      than 28 weeks' gestation with the ventilators used in this study.

TI  - A prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing telmisartan 80 mg with
      valsartan 80 mg in patients with mild to moderate hypertension using ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 1123-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of
      telmisartan 80 mg with valsartan 80 mg throughout a 24 h dosing interval. DESIGN:
      A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point, parallel group study.
      Treatment efficacy was compared using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      (ABPM), cuff sphygmomanometry and calculated responder rates. Tolerability was
      assessed by physical examination, laboratory parameters, 12-lead
      electrocardiogram, blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, and evaluation of
      adverse events. SETTING: Thirty-five centres in the United States. PATIENTS: Four
      hundred and twenty-six patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension
      entered the study. Ninety-two per cent (n=393) completed the study.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent a four-week, single-blind, placebo run-in
      period before being randomly assigned to once-daily oral telmisartan 80 mg
      (n=214) or valsartan 80 mg (n=212) for an eight-week, open-label treatment
      period. RESULTS: Treatment with telmisartan was associated with a significantly
      greater mean reduction from baseline in the last 6 h ABPM mean for diastolic
      blood pressure compared with the valsartan-treated group (-7.5+/-0.6 mmHg versus 
      -5.2+/-0.6 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01). Secondary analyses showed significantly
      greater efficacy with telmisartan 80 mg than with valsartan 80 mg, including
      greater mean reductions from baseline of ABPM (systolic blood pressure and
      diastolic blood pressure) during the daytime (06:00 to 21:59) and morning (06:00 
      to11:59) hours, and larger decreases in trough cuff blood pressure (P<0.01). Both
      treatments showed placebo-like tolerability profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Telmisartan 80
      mg once daily was superior to valsartan 80 mg once daily in reducing diastolic
      blood pressure during the last 6 h of the 24 h dosing interval. These results may
      be due to telmisartan's longer plasma half-life or to a higher potency compared
      with valsartan, such that a higher dose of valsartan may produce effects similar 
      to those of 80 mg telmisartan. These data confirm the long duration of action of 
      telmisartan with consistent and sustained control of blood pressure over 24 h and
      during the last 6 h of the dosing interval. Both treatments were well tolerated; 
      the adverse event data confirmed the excellent tolerability profiles of
      telmisartan and valsartan that have been reported previously.

TI  - Rofecoxib, a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2, with clinical efficacy
      comparable with that of diclofenac sodium: results of a one-year, randomized,
      clinical trial in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. Rofecoxib
      Phase III Protocol 035 Study Group.
PG  - 978-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of rofecoxib, a specific inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), with that of diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis
      (OA) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rofecoxib. METHODS: We
      performed a randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled trial in 784
      adults with OA of the knee or hip. Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups: 12.5 mg of rofecoxib once daily, 25 mg of rofecoxib once daily, and 50 mg
      of diclofenac 3 times daily. Clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated over a
      1-year continuous treatment period. RESULTS: Rofecoxib at dosages of 12.5 and 25 
      mg demonstrated efficacy that was clinically comparable to that of diclofenac, as
      assessed by all 3 primary end points according to predefined comparability
      criteria. Results from secondary end points were consistent with those of the
      primary end points. There were small statistical differences favoring diclofenac 
      for 2 of the end points. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION:
      Rofecoxib was well tolerated and provided efficacy that was clinically
      comparable, according to predefined statistical criteria, to that of 150 mg of
      diclofenac per day in this 1-year study. Specific inhibition of COX-2 provided
      therapeutic efficacy in OA.

TI  - Fish oil supplementation improves docosahexaenoic acid status of malnourished
      infants.
PG  - 366-9
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether the low docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status of
      malnourished, mostly breast fed, Pakistani children can be improved by fish oil
      (FO) supplementation. METHODS: Ten malnourished children (aged 8-30 months)
      received 500 mg FO daily for nine weeks. The supplement contained 62.8 mol% (314 
      mg) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of the omega3 series (LCPUFAomega3)
      and 22.5 mol% (112 mg) DHA. Seven FO unsupplemented children served as controls. 
      Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acids were analysed at baseline and at the study end. 
      RESULTS: FO supplementation augmented mean (SD) RBC DHA from 2.27 (0.81) to 3.35 
      (0.76) mol%, without significantly affecting the concentrations of LCPUFAomega6. 
      Unsupplemented children showed no RBC fatty acid changes. One FO supplemented
      child with very low initial RBC arachidonic acid showed a remarkable increase
      from 4.04 to 13.84 mol%, whereas another with high RBC arachidonic acid showed a 
      decrease from 15.64 to 10.46 mol%. CONCLUSION: FO supplementation improves the
      DHA status of malnourished children. The supplement is apparently well absorbed
      and not exclusively used as a source of energy.

TI  - Hormone replacement therapy: effect of progestin dose and time since menopause on
      endometrial bleeding.
PG  - 899-905
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of two continuous combined hormone replacement 
      regimens on bleeding profiles in postmenopausal women, based on progestin dose
      and time since the patient's last spontaneous menstrual period. METHODS: A
      randomized, double-masked, multicenter trial was conducted in 1724 women
      recruited from 99 sites. Six hundred seventy-eight women received a continuous
      regimen of oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg/day, combined with
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 2.5 or 5.0 mg/day, for 1 year. RESULTS: After 
      1 year, no bleeding was reported by over 89% of women. More women in the 5.0
      mg/day MPA group than in the 2.5 mg/day MPA group reported no bleeding (93.8%
      versus 89.5%; P<.089). Of those women who had had their last menstrual period 3
      years ago or less, a significantly higher percentage in the 5.0 mg/day MPA group 
      (72.4%) did not experience bleeding after three cycles compared with the 2.5 mg
      group (59.0%; P<.001). Although the percentage of patients without bleeding was
      also higher in the 5.0 mg/day MPA group after six cycles and 1 year, the
      differences between groups were not statistically significant. Of the women who
      had their last menstrual period more than 3 years ago, 94.7% of those in the 5.0 
      mg/day MPA group and 90.7% of those in the 2.5 mg/day MPA group reported no
      bleeding at 1 year. CONCLUSION: A continuous combined regimen of CEE plus 5.0 mg 
      MPA may be more suitable for women closer to the onset of menopause or for women 
      starting therapy who are unwilling to tolerate irregular bleeding. The improved
      bleeding profile with CEE and 5.0 mg/day MPA is likely to enhance compliance with
      hormone replacement therapy.

TI  - Atorvastatin but not L-arginine improves endothelial function in type I diabetes 
      mellitus: a double-blind study.
PG  - 410-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the effects of oral L-arginine and the
      hexamethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor atorvastatin on endothelial
      function in young patients with type I diabetes mellitus (DM). BACKGROUND:
      Endothelial dysfunction, a key early event in atherosclerosis, occurs in young
      patients with type I DM, and its reversal may benefit the progression of vascular
      disease. Cholesterol reduction in L-arginine improve endothelial function in
      nondiabetic subjects, but their effect in patients with type I DM is unknown.
      METHODS: In a double-blind, 2x2 factorial study, we investigated the effect of
      L-arginine (7 g twice daily) and atorvastatin (40 mg/day) on conduit artery
      vascular function in 84 normocholesterolemic young adults (mean+/-SD: age 34
      years [range 18 to 46], low density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol 2.96+/-0.89
      mmol/liter) with type I DM. Brachial artery dilation to flow (flow-mediated
      dilation [FMD]) and to the direct smooth muscle dilator glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)
      were assessed noninvasively using high resolution ultrasound at baseline and
      after six weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Atorvastatin resulted in a 48+/-10%
      decrease in serum LDL cholesterol levels, whereas L-arginine levels increased by 
      247+/-141% after L-arginine therapy. By analysis of covariance, treatment with
      atorvastatin resulted in a significant increase in FMD (p = 0.018. L-Arginine
      therapy had no significant effect on endothelial function, and there was no
      significant change in dilation to GTN after either intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      young patients with type I DM, improvement in endothelial dysfunction can be
      demonstrated after just six weeks of treatment with atorvastatin. In contrast to 
      studies of hypercholesterolemia, however, L-arginine had no benefit. Treatment
      with atorvastatin at an early stage may have an impact on the progression of
      atherosclerosis in these high risk patients.

TI  - A randomized trial of weighted vest use in ambulatory older adults: strength,
      performance, and quality of life outcomes.
PG  - 305-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower extremity weakness is a major risk factor for falls and hip
      fractures. Aging muscle is capable of responding to strengthening techniques.
      Strategies for providing accessible, inexpensive, safe, and effective
      strengthening programs for older adults are needed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate
      whether use of a weighted vest improved strength, physical performance, markers
      of bone turnover, or health-related quality of life. DESIGN: A 27-week
      randomized, controlled, unmasked clinical trial. The primary outcome was peak
      isokinetic knee extensor strength at follow-up, adjusted for baseline strength.
      SETTING: Home-based program. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 62 women and men, mean age 
      74 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized to: no vest (n = 21), 3% body
      weight (BW) vest (n = 19), or 5% BW vest (n = 22). The vest is a nylon garment
      with pockets that are loaded with adjustable weights. The vest was prescribed for
      2 hours daily, 4 days per week. No specific physical activities were mandated.
      MEASUREMENTS: All measures were made at baseline and 27 weeks. These included:
      knee strength and endurance by isokinetic dynamometer; timed physical performance
      tests; serum osteocalcin and urinary N-telopeptides; and health-related quality
      of life scales. RESULTS: Follow-up values of muscular strength and endurance,
      physical performance, bone turnover markers, and health-related quality of life
      did not differ by treatment assignment. The final study visit was attended by 19 
      (90%), 15 (80%), and 20 (91%) of the control, 3%, and 5% groups, respectively.
      Three permanent discontinuations of vest use occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Weighted vest
      use did not result in improvement in multiple domains of strength and function
      and did not affect bone turnover markers. We conclude that the training stimulus 
      afforded by the vest (at the dosage tested) was below the required amount to
      produce strength gains or bone stimulation.

      Vaccine Investigators.
PG  - 881-9
AB  - A phase II efficacy trial was conducted with recombinant human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) type 1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 (rgp160) in 608 HIV-infected,
      asymptomatic volunteers with CD4+ cell counts >400 cells/mm3. During a 5-year
      study, volunteers received a 6-shot primary series of immunizations with either
      rgp160 or placebo over 6 months, followed by booster immunizations every 2
      months. Repeated vaccination with rgp160 was safe and persistently immunogenic.
      Adequate follow-up and acquisition of endpoints allowed for definitive
      interpretation of the trial results. There was no evidence that rgp160 has
      efficacy as a therapeutic vaccine in early-stage HIV infection, as measured at
      primary endpoints (50% decline in CD4+ cell count or disease progression to
      Walter Reed stage 4, 5, or 6) or secondary endpoints. A transient improvement was
      seen in the secondary CD4 endpoint for the vaccination compared with the placebo 
      arm, but this did not translate into improved clinical outcome.

      choice in patients with suspected endobronchial carcinoma, but it is often
      non-diagnostic. Once a positive diagnosis has been made, many patients undergo
      staging by computed tomographic (CT) scanning to assess the extent of the disease
      and its suitability for radical treatment. To determine whether initial CT
      scanning before FOB is a cost effective way of reducing subsequent unnecessary or
      unhelpful invasive diagnostic procedures, a study was undertaken in 171 patients 
      with suspected endobronchial carcinoma. METHODS: A randomised two group study was
      performed with all patients undergoing an initial CT staging scan. In group A the
      CT scans were reviewed before FOB, allowing cancellation or a change to an
      alternative invasive procedure if considered appropriate. In group B all patients
      proceeded to FOB with the bronchoscopist blinded to the result of the CT scan
      until after the procedure. RESULTS: In group A six of 90 patients (7%) required
      no further investigations as the CT scan was either normal, consistent with
      benign disease, or consistent with widespread metastatic disease. Of the
      remainder, bronchoscopy was diagnostic in 50 of 68 (73%) in group A compared with
      44 of 81 (54%) in group B (p = 0.015). Overall, a positive diagnosis was made
      after a single invasive investigation in 64 of 84 patients (76%) in group A
      compared with only 45 of 81 patients (55%) in group B (p = 0.005). Only seven of 
      90 patients (8%) in group A required more than one invasive investigation
      compared with 15 of 81 patients (18.5%) in group B. In patients with malignancy, 
      bronchoscopy was more likely to be diagnostic in group A (50 of 56 patients
      (89%)) than in group B (44 of 62 (71%); p = 0. 012), and the diagnosis was more
      frequently made on the initial invasive investigation (group A, 63 of 70 (90%);
      group B, 44 of 62 (71%); p = 0.004). Because of the lower number of invasive
      procedures performed in group A than in group B, the cost of performing CT scans 
      before FOB in all patients in group A would have equated to a projected cost of
      performing CT scans in 60% of patients after FOB in group B. CONCLUSIONS:
      Performing initial CT thoracic scans before bronchoscopy in patients with
      suspected endobronchial malignancy is a cost effective way of improving
      diagnostic yield from invasive diagnostic procedures and occasionally may obviate
      the need for any further investigation.

TI  - Failure of the combination of sequential oral and transdermal estradiol plus
      norethisterone acetate to affect plasma homocysteine levels.
PG  - 1080-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A high level of plasma homocysteine may be deleterious to vascular
      health. We therefore compared the effect of combinations of sequential oral and
      transdermal estradiol plus norethisterone acetate on plasma homocysteine. DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized study. SETTING: Outpatient department of obstetrics and
      gynecology in a university hospital. PATIENT(S): Forty-two healthy, nonsmoking
      postmenopausal women starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to control
      climacteric symptoms. INTERVENTION(S): In a randomized order, the women started
      using either oral HRT (2 mg of estradiol on days 1-12, 2 mg of estradiol plus 1
      mg of norethisterone acetate (NETA) on days 13-22, and 1mg of estradiol on days
      23-28; n = 21) or transdermal HRT (50 microg/d of estradiol on days 1-28 and 250 
      microg/d of norethisterone acetate on days 15-28, n = 21) for 1 year. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Fasting plasma levels of homocysteine were measured before
      the treatment and during the combined estradiol-plus-NETA phases of the sixth and
      12th treatment cycles. RESULT(S): Basal homocysteine levels in the oral group
      (8.2 +/- 3.1 micromol/L, mean plusmn;SD) and transdermal group (8.7 plusmn; 1.8
      micromol/L, mean plusmn;SD) were not affected by the estradiol-plus-NETA
      combination. CONCLUSION(S): Neither an oral nor a transdermal combination of
      sequential estradiol and NETA causes significant changes in plasma homocysteine
      in Finnish postmenopausal women with normal baseline homocysteine levels.

TI  - Effects of physiologic pacing versus ventricular pacing on the risk of stroke and
      death due to cardiovascular causes. Canadian Trial of Physiologic Pacing
      Investigators.
PG  - 1385-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that physiologic pacing (dual-chamber or atrial)
      may be superior to single-chamber (ventricular) pacing because it is associated
      with lower risks of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and death. These benefits have
      not been evaluated in a large, randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: At 32
      Canadian centers, patients without chronic atrial fibrillation who were scheduled
      for a first implantation of a pacemaker to treat symptomatic bradycardia were
      eligible for enrollment. We randomly assigned patients to receive either a
      ventricular pacemaker or a physiologic pacemaker and followed them for an average
      of three years. The primary outcome was stroke or death due to cardiovascular
      causes. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, atrial fibrillation, and
      hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS: A total of 1474 patients were
      randomly assigned to receive a ventricular pacemaker and 1094 to receive a
      physiologic pacemaker. The annual rate of stroke or death due to cardiovascular
      causes was 5.5 percent with ventricular pacing, as compared with 4.9 percent with
      physiologic pacing (reduction in relative risk, 9.4 percent; 95 percent
      confidence interval, -10.5 to 25.7 percent [the negative value indicates an
      increase in risk]; P=0.33). The annual rate of atrial fibrillation was
      significantly lower among the patients in the physiologic-pacing group (5.3
      percent) than among those in the ventricular-pacing group (6.6 percent), for a
      reduction in relative risk of 18.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.3
      to 32.6 percent; P=0.05). The effect on the rate of atrial fibrillation was not
      apparent until two years after implantation. The observed annual rates of death
      from all causes and of hospitalization for heart failure were lower among the
      patients with a physiologic pacemaker than among those with a ventricular
      pacemaker, but not significantly so (annual rates of death, 6.6 percent with
      ventricular pacing and 6.3 percent with physiologic pacing; annual rates of
      hospitalization for heart failure, 3.5 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively).
      There were significantly more perioperative complications with physiologic pacing
      than with ventricular pacing (9.0 percent vs. 3.8 percent, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Physiologic pacing provides little benefit over ventricular pacing for the
      prevention of stroke or death due to cardiovascular causes.

TI  - Phase III randomized trial of amifostine as a radioprotector in head and neck
      cancer.
PG  - 3339-45
AB  - PURPOSE: Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer causes acute and chronic
      xerostomia and acute mucositis. Amifositine and its active metabolite, WR-1065,
      accumulate with high concentrations in the salivary glands. This randomized trial
      evaluated whether amifostine could ameliorate these side effects without
      compromising the effectiveness of radiotherapy in these patients. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Patients with previously untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      were eligible. Primary end points included the incidence of grade > or =2 acute
      xerostomia, grade > or =3 acute mucositis, and grade > or =2 late xerostomia and 
      were based on the worst toxicity reported. Amifostine was administered (200
      mg/m(2) intravenous) daily 15 to 30 minutes before irradiation. Radiotherapy was 
      given once daily (1.8 to 2.0 Gy) to doses of 50 to 70 Gy. Whole saliva production
      was quantitated preradiotherapy and regularly during follow-up. Patients
      evaluated their symptoms through a questionnaire during and after treatment.
      Local-regional control was the primary antitumor efficacy end point. RESULTS:
      Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and allergic reactions were the most common side
      effects. Fifty-three percent of the patients receiving amifostine had at least
      one episode of nausea and/or vomiting, but it only occurred with 233 (5%) of
      4,314 doses. Amifostine reduced grade > or =2 acute xerostomia from 78% to 51%
      (P<.0001) and chronic xerostomia grade > or = 2 from 57% to 34% (P=.002). Median 
      saliva production was greater with amifostine (0.26 g v 0.10 g, P=.04).
      Amifostine did not reduce mucositis. With and without amifostine, 2-year
      local-regional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 58%
      versus 63%, 53% versus 57%, and 71% versus 66%, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      Amifostine reduced acute and chronic xerostomia. Antitumor treatment efficacy was
      preserved.

TI  - Recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against CD18 (rhuMAb CD18) in traumatic
      hemorrhagic shock: results of a phase II clinical trial. Traumatic Shock Group.
PG  - 611-9; discussion 619-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activated neutrophils have been shown to play a pivotal role in
      resuscitation injury after traumatic hemorrhagic shock. Blocking the adhesion of 
      neutrophils with a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against CD18 (rhuMAb
      CD18) may reduce resuscitation injury but increase the risk of infection. This
      was a dose-finding phase II study to determine safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and clinical outcome parameters for additional studies.
      METHODS: This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized (3:1),
      double-blind phase II trial enrolling 116 blunt and penetrating trauma patients
      from 14 trauma centers over a 9-month period. Patients with hypotension (blood
      pressure < or =90 mm Hg) from hemorrhagic shock were given a single intravenous
      dose of rhuMAb CD18 or placebo. The three doses tested were 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg. 
      The drug was administered within 4 hours of the hypotensive episode and no later 
      than 6 hours from time of injury. Exclusion criteria included head injury
      resulting in Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 8 or a history of cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation in the trauma center. An independent Drug Safety and Monitoring
      Review Board periodically reviewed unblinded data for safety issues and to give
      approval for dose escalation. RESULTS: Minor and major infection rates in rhuMAb 
      CD18 groups were comparable to placebo. There was no evidence of antibody
      formation against rhuMAb CD18. Linear PK was observed within the dose range
      studied. Duration of neutrophil binding was dose-dependent, with 2 mg/kg
      resulting in greater than 90% neutrophil CD18 receptor saturation for
      approximately 48 hours. The mortality was 6.7% (2 of 30) in the placebo group,
      4.8% (1 of 21) in the 0.5-mg/kg group, 8.5% (4 of 47) in the 1-mg/kg group, and
      0% (0 of 18) in the 2-mg/kg group. The study was not powered for efficacy, and
      none of the efficacy variables demonstrated statistical significance. Favorable
      trends were seen in the 2-mg/kg group as compared with placebo in median
      intensive care unit length of stay (5 vs. 9 days) and median time on ventilator
      (34 vs. 72 hours). CONCLUSIONS: A single 2-mg/kg dose of rhuMAb CD18 maintains
      greater than 90% saturation of neutrophil CD18 receptors for approximately 48
      hours in patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock undergoing resuscitation.
      There was no trend toward increased infection. A larger trial is needed to
      demonstrate the clinical efficacy of rhuMAb CD18, perhaps using more reliable
      endpoints.

TI  - Estrogen improves motor disability in parkinsonian postmenopausal women with
      motor fluctuations.
PG  - 2292-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of low-dose oral estrogen 
      in postmenopausal women with PD associated with motor fluctuations. BACKGROUND:
      Motor fluctuations in PD may be predictable or unpredictable, and eventually
      affect most patients after long-term levodopa therapy. Although estrogen can
      modulate nigrostriatal dopamine levels, its effects on PD are unclear. METHODS:
      Patients were randomized to receive conjugated estrogen (oral Premarin 0.625 mg
      daily; n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) in a double-blind, parallel-group, prospective
      study over 8 weeks. Existing antiparkinsonian drug regimes were kept unchanged.
      Changes in "on" and "off" periods using patient diaries, Unified Parkinson's
      Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, timed tapping score, and Hamilton Depression 
      Scale score were determined by one rater. Subgroup analyses were also performed
      on patients with only predictable motor fluctuations. RESULTS: Both treatment
      groups were similar in age, duration of disease and menopause, antiparkinsonian
      medication, and compliance with test medication and diary assessments. "On" and
      "off" times, and motor score (UPDRS subscale III) improved with estrogen, using
      the Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05 after Bonferroni adjustment). Mean "on" time
      improved by 7% (9 hours/week of awake time) in estrogen-treated patients versus a
      deterioration of 0.5% (1.4 hours) in placebo-treated patients (95% confidence
      interval, [CI] of mean difference, 5.73 to 14.9). Mean "off" time improved by 4% 
      (4.4 hours/week of awake time) in estrogen-treated patients versus no change in
      placebo-treated patients (95% CI, 1.54 to 7.16). Mean subscale III score improved
      by 3.5 points in estrogen-treated patients versus 0.4 in placebo-treated patients
      (95% CI, 1.02 to 5.18). No other significant changes were observed (p > 0.05).
      Subgroup analyses in patients with only predictable motor fluctuations showed
      similar results, except improvement in mean subscale III score was marginally not
      significant (p = 0.07; 95% CI, 1.06 to 6.24). Five patients on estrogen had
      facial flushing, three had lower abdominal discomfort, and two had mild
      withdrawal vaginal bleeding. The adverse events were mild and resolved without
      sequelae. CONCLUSION: Low-dose estrogen is a safe and effective adjunct therapy
      to existing antiparkinsonian treatment in reducing motor disability in
      postmenopausal women with PD associated with motor fluctuations.

TI  - Randomized comparison of glyceryl trinitrate and prostaglandin E2 for cervical
      ripening at term.
PG  - 549-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the adverse effects of glyceryl trinitrate compared with
      prostaglandin (PG) E2 vaginal tablet for cervical ripening in term pregnancy.
      METHODS: One hundred ten women with term pregnancies referred for induction of
      labor with Bishop scores of 6 or less were randomly assigned to receive a
      500-microg glyceryl trinitrate tablet vaginally (n = 54) or a 3-mg PGE2 tablet
      vaginally (n = 56), every 6 hours for maximum of two doses. Subjects were sent to
      the labor ward for amniotomy or oxytocin if their Bishop scores were more than 6 
      or their cervices were not ripe 24 hours after treatment. Adverse effects,
      changes in the Bishop scores, progress, and outcomes of labor were assessed.
      RESULTS: Glyceryl trinitrate was associated with fewer episodes of uterine
      tachysystole (0% versus 9%; P =.02). The median Bishop score after 12 hours was
      lower in women given glyceryl trinitrate compared with those given PGE2. Adverse 
      effects, including headache and palpitations, were more frequent with glyceryl
      trinitrate than with PGE2. The cesarean rate was not significantly different
      between groups. CONCLUSION: Cervical ripening with glyceryl trinitrate resulted
      in fewer episodes of tachysystole, but there were significantly more minor side
      effects. It can be used for cervical ripening at term, but it was not as
      effective as PGE2.

TI  - Office prenatal formula advertising and its effect on breast-feeding patterns.
PG  - 296-303
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of formula company-produced materials about
      infant feeding to breast-feeding promotion materials without formula advertising 
      on breast-feeding initiation and duration. METHODS: Five hundred forty-seven
      pregnant women were randomized to receive either formula company (commercial; n =
      277) or specially designed (research; n = 270) educational packs about infant
      feeding at their first prenatal visit. Feeding method was determined at delivery.
      Breast-feeding duration of the 294 women who chose to breast-feed was ascertained
      at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Survival analyses were used to evaluate continuous
      outcomes, and chi2 and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate
      discrete outcomes. RESULTS: Breast-feeding initiation (relative risk [RR] 0.93,
      95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61, 1.43) and duration after 2 weeks (hazard ratio
      1.19, 95% CI 0.86, 1.64) were not affected. Women in the commercial group were
      more likely to cease breast-feeding before hospital discharge (RR 5.80, 95% CI
      1.25, 54.01) and before 2 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% CI 1.02,
      3.55). In subgroup analyses, women with uncertain goals for breast-feeding or
      goals of 12 weeks or less experienced shortened exclusive (hazard ratio 1.53, 95%
      CI 1.06, 2.21), full (hazard ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.18, 2.48), and overall (hazard 
      ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.16, 2.64) breast-feeding duration when exposed to the
      commercial intervention. CONCLUSION: Although breast-feeding initiation and
      long-term duration were not affected, exposure to formula promotion materials
      increased significantly breast-feeding cessation in the first 2 weeks.
      Additionally, among women with uncertain goals or breast-feeding goals of 12
      weeks or less, exclusive, full, and overall breast-feeding duration were
      shortened. Educational materials about infant feeding should support
      unequivocally breast-feeding as optimal nutrition for infants; formula promotion 
      products should be eliminated from prenatal settings.

TI  - Diabetes mellitus and outcome after primary coronary angioplasty for acute
      myocardial infarction: lessons from the GUSTO-IIb Angioplasty Substudy. Global
      Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries in Acute Coronary Syndromes.
PG  - 1502-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the efficacy of primary angioplasty in diabetics
      versus nondiabetics and to evaluate the relative benefits of angioplasty over
      thrombolytic therapy among diabetics. BACKGROUND: Primary angioplasty for
      myocardial infarction is at least as effective as thrombolytic therapy in the
      general population. However, the influence of diabetic status on outcome after
      primary angioplasty versus thrombolysis remains unknown. METHODS: Patients in the
      Global Use of Strategies To Open Occluded Arteries in Acute Coronary Syndromes
      (GUSTO-IIb) Angioplasty Substudy were randomized to receive either primary
      angioplasty or accelerated alteplase. The interaction of diabetic status
      (diabetics n = 177, nondiabetics n = 961) and treatment strategy with the
      occurrence of the primary end point (death, nonfatal reinfarction or nonfatal,
      disabling stroke at 30 days) was analyzed (power to detect a 40% relative
      reduction in the primary end point with alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.20). Among
      patients who were randomized to and underwent primary angioplasty, procedural
      success (defined as residual stenosis <50% and TIMI grade 3 flow) was assessed
      based on diabetic status. RESULTS: Compared with nondiabetics, diabetics had
      worse baseline clinical and angiographic profiles. Despite more severe stenosis
      and poorer flow in the culprit artery, procedural success with angioplasty was
      similar for diabetics (n = 81; 70.4%) and nondiabetics (n = 391; 72.4%). Outcome 
      at 30 days was better for nondiabetics randomized to angioplasty versus alteplase
      (adjusted odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.96) with a similar
      trend for diabetics (0.70, [0.29-1.72]). We noted no interaction between diabetic
      status and treatment strategy on outcome (p = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Primary
      angioplasty was similarly successful in diabetics and nondiabetics and appeared
      to be more effective than thrombolytic therapy among diabetics with acute
      infarction.

TI  - Beneficial effects of intracoronary adenosine as an adjunct to primary
      angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 2154-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of vessel recanalization in acute myocardial infarction 
      (AMI) are limited by reperfusion damage. In animal models, adenosine limits
      reperfusion injury, reducing infarct size and improving ventricular function. The
      aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of adenosine adjunct
      to primary PTCA in AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-four AMI patients undergoing
      primary PTCA were randomized to intracoronary adenosine or saline. The 2 groups
      were similar for age, sex, and infarct location. Adenosine administration was
      feasible and well tolerated. PTCA was successful in all patients and resulted in 
      TIMI 3 flow in all patients given adenosine and in 19 given saline (P<0.05). The 
      no-reflow phenomenon occurred in 1 adenosine patient and in 7 saline patients
      (P=0.02). Creatine kinase was lower in the adenosine group, and a Q-wave MI
      developed in 16 adenosine patients and in 23 saline patients (P=0.04). Sixty-four
      percent of dyssynergic segments improved in the adenosine group and 36% in the
      saline group (P=0. 001). Function worsened in 2% of dysynergic segments in the
      adenosine group and in 20% in the saline group (P=0.0001). Adverse cardiac events
      occurred in 5 patients in the adenosine group and in 13 patients in the saline
      group (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Intracoronary adenosine administration is feasible
      and well tolerated in AMI. Adenosine adjunct to primary PTCA ameliorates flow,
      prevents the no-reflow phenomenon, improves ventricular function, and is
      associated with a more favorable clinical course.

TI  - Evaluation of platelet activation in depressed patients with ischemic heart
      disease after paroxetine or nortriptyline treatment.
PG  - 137-40
AB  - This study investigated the effects of antidepressant treatment on platelet
      activation in depressed patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). Plasma levels
      of platelet alpha-granule release products beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) and
      platelet factor 4 (PF4) were measured in 17 depressed patients with IHD who were 
      treated in a 6-week, double-blind trial with either paroxetine (10 patients) or
      nortriptyline (7 patients). Baseline measurements of BTG and PF4 were
      significantly elevated in both drug treatment groups before the initiation of
      antidepressant therapy compared with those of healthy control subjects. In the
      paroxetine group, mean PF4 and BTG levels significantly decreased from these
      elevated baseline values within 1 week of treatment and remained low at 3- and
      6-week measurements. In contrast, the nortriptyline group did not exhibit a
      significant decrease in PF4 or BTG plasma levels after 1, 3, or 6 weeks of
      treatment. Therefore, platelet activation in depressed patients with IHD seems to
      be inhibited by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine. The effect
      of paroxetine on PF4 and BTG plasma levels suggests that it may reduce platelet
      aggregation in vivo and may positively impact IHD-related mortality in this
      population.

TI  - Comparison of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy alone and in combination with
      octreotide in controlling acute variceal hemorrhage and early rebleeding in
      patients with low-risk cirrhosis.
PG  - 768-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Efficacy of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) alone and in
      combination with octreotide in controlling acute variceal bleeding and preventing
      early rebleeding was compared in a double-blind study. METHODS: Consecutive
      patients presenting with variceal bleeding with low-risk liver cirrhosis were
      randomized into two groups. Group A received EVS with 3-5 ml of ethanolamine
      oleate per varix and placebo injection at 50 microg/h; group B received the
      combined therapy of EVS and octreotide 50 microg/h continuously for 5 days. A
      total of 70 patients (mean age, 38.4 +/- 8.6 yr) were selected for the study,
      which included 56 men (mean age, 37.9 +/- 8.5 yr) and 14 women (mean age, 40.6
      +/- 9.0 yr). Thirty-five patients were allocated in each group. RESULTS: In group
      A bleeding was controlled in 30 patients (85.7%) and in group B in 33 (94.3%) (p 
      = 0.24). The number of patients who rebled during the first 5 days after
      sclerotherapy was eight (22.9%) and two (5.7%) in groups A and B, respectively (p
      = 0.04). The mean packs of blood transfused to the patients of groups A and B
      were 2.1 +/- 1.2 packs and 1.5 +/- 0.7 packs, respectively (p = 0.03). The mean
      hospital stay of group A was 6.6 +/- 1.3 days, whereas that in group B was 5.9
      +/- 1.2 days (p = 0.04). One patient from each group died during the course of
      the study. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was observed in arrest of
      bleeding in the two groups, but episodes of early rebleeding, blood transfusions,
      and hospital stay was significantly less in group B.

TI  - Effect of SR49059, an orally active V1a vasopressin receptor antagonist, in the
      prevention of dysmenorrhoea.
PG  - 614-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effect of SR49059 when given shortly
      before the onset of menstruation as a preventative treatment of dysmenorrhoea.
      DESIGN: A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in
      complete block design (three periods, three treatments). SETTING: A clinical
      research organisation in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 18-35 years
      suffering from primary dysmenorrhoea. INTERVENTIONS: In each of three menstrual
      cycles, women reported to the study centre and were given a daily dose of either 
      placebo, 100 mg or 300 mg SR49059 from a minimum of 4 hours up to a maximum of
      three days before the onset of bleeding and/or menstrual pain. If this did not
      control the pain, women were allowed once a day to take a second dose of study
      treatment providing that at least 4 hours had passed since the first drug intake.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intensity of menstrual pain recorded by means of a visual 
      analogue scale. Rating of symptoms of dysmenorrhoea (mainly back and pelvic pain)
      in relation to functional capacity (Sultan score). Self-assessment of menstrual
      blood loss in a menstrual diary record. RESULTS: Analysis of intensity of
      menstrual pain, as recorded by visual analogue scale and Sultan pain score (back 
      and pelvic pain) during the first 24 hours of dysmenorrhoea, showed a
      dose-related effect of SR49059. The 300 mg dose of SR49059 was significantly more
      effective than placebo. Similarly, a dose-related effect of SR49059 was shown on 
      total Sultan score. SR49059 was well tolerated and no significant effect on the
      bleeding pattern was noted. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed for the first time a
      therapeutic effect of an orally active vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist in the
      prevention of dysmenorrhoea. Further studies are required to examine effect
      mechanisms and determine effective doses.

TI  - The effects of moxonidine, a novel imidazoline, on plasma norepinephrine in
      patients with congestive heart failure. Moxonidine Investigators.
PG  - 398-404
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dose response relationship of moxonidine on plasma
      concentration of norepinephrine during acute and chronic administration in
      patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUND: Sympathetic activation 
      is increased in heart failure. Moxonidine is an imidazoline ligand acting on the 
      central nervous system (CNS) receptors to decrease sympathetic activation.
      METHODS: Ninety-seven patients with heart failure and New York Heart Association 
      class II-III symptoms and ejection fraction <40% were randomized to placebo or
      one of three target doses of moxonidine, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 mg administered twice
      daily. An initial dose of moxonidine 0.1 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) was followed by 
      weekly increments of 0.1 mg b.i.d. until target dose. The second and third study 
      days occurred after four weeks (at target dose) and after 12 weeks, respectively.
      At each study day, repeated blood samples were drawn. RESULTS: There was a
      significant dose-related decrease of systolic blood pressure across all three
      study days. Heart rate decreased significantly on study day 3 in a dose-related
      manner. The acute 2 h decrease in plasma norepinephrine in response to all three 
      doses of moxonidine was significantly different compared with placebo after four 
      and 12 weeks. There was a significant linear relation between dose and plasma
      norepinephrine after four and 12 weeks in both 2 h peak and the time averaged
      effect (>8 h). The number of adverse events was similar in the moxonidine and
      placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: The increased sympathetic activation in CHF can be
      reduced by moxonidine through CNS inhibition.

TI  - Effectiveness of massage therapy for subacute low-back pain: a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1815-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of massage therapy for low-back pain has not been
      documented. This randomized controlled trial compared comprehensive massage
      therapy (soft-tissue manipulation, remedial exercise and posture education), 2
      components of massage therapy and placebo in the treatment of subacute (between 1
      week and 8 months) low-back pain. METHODS: Subjects with subacute low-back pain
      were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: comprehensive massage therapy (n = 25), 
      soft-tissue manipulation only (n = 25), remedial exercise with posture education 
      only (n = 22) or a placebo of sham laser therapy (n = 26). Each subject received 
      6 treatments within approximately 1 month. Outcome measures obtained at baseline,
      after treatment and at 1-month follow-up consisted of the Roland Disability
      Questionnaire (RDQ), the McGill Pain Questionnaire (PPI and PRI), the State
      Anxiety Index and the Modified Schober test (lumbar range of motion). RESULTS: Of
      the 107 subjects who passed screening, 98 (92%) completed post-treatment tests
      and 91 (85%) completed follow-up tests. Statistically significant differences
      were noted after treatment and at follow-up. The comprehensive massage therapy
      group had improved function (mean RDQ score 1.54 v. 2.86-6.5, p < 0.001), less
      intense pain (mean PPI score 0.42 v. 1.18-1.75, p < 0.001) and a decrease in the 
      quality of pain (mean PRI score 2.29 v. 4.55-7.71, p = 0.006) compared with the
      other 3 groups. Clinical significance was evident for the comprehensive massage
      therapy group and the soft-tissue manipulation group on the measure of function. 
      At 1-month follow-up 63% of subjects in the comprehensive massage therapy group
      reported no pain as compared with 27% of the soft-tissue manipulation group, 14% 
      of the remedial exercise group and 0% of the sham laser therapy group.
      INTERPRETATION: Patients with subacute low-back pain were shown to benefit from
      massage therapy, as regulated by the College of Massage Therapists of Ontario and
      delivered by experienced massage therapists.

TI  - Autoclaved Leishmania major vaccine for prevention of visceral leishmaniasis: a
      randomised, double-blind, BCG-controlled trial in Sudan.
PG  - 1565-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      the Sudan. Drug treatment is expensive, and drug resistance is becoming
      increasingly common. Safe, effective, and cheap vaccines are needed. We report
      the results of a vaccine trial against human visceral leishmaniasis. METHODS: We 
      undertook a double-blind randomised trial to test the safety and efficacy of an
      autoclaved Leishmania major (ALM) promastigote vaccine (1 mg per dose). Of 5093
      volunteers screened, 2306 had negative leishmanin skin tests and reciprocal
      titres of less than 6400 in the direct agglutination test. They were randomly
      assigned two doses of ALM mixed with BCG or BCG alone. Volunteers were followed
      up for 2 years. The primary endpoint was clinical visceral leishmaniasis or
      post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Analyses were by intention to treat.
      FINDINGS: Side-effects were confined to the injection site. The cumulative
      frequency of visceral leishmaniasis at 2 years did not differ significantly
      between the group assigned ALM plus BCG and that assigned BCG alone (133/1155
      [11.5%] vs 141/1151 [12.3%], p=0.6). The vaccine efficacy was 6% (95% CI -18 to
      25). The proportion of individuals showing leishmanin skin conversion was
      significantly higher in the ALM plus BCG group than in the BCG alone group
      throughout follow-up (303 [30%] vs 72 [7%] at 42 days). Individuals whose
      leishmanin test converted after vaccination (induration > or =5 mm) had a
      significantly lower frequency of visceral leishmaniasis than non-responders
      (27/375 [7.2%] vs 210/1660 [12.7%], p=0.003). INTERPRETATION: We found no
      evidence that two doses of ALM plus BCG offered significant protective immunity
      against visceral leishmaniasis compared with BCG alone. Leishmanin skin
      conversion with an induration of 5 mm or more in either group was associated with
      protection from the disease.

TI  - Consequences of delayed therapy with second-line agents in rheumatoid arthritis: 
      a 3 year followup on the hydroxychloroquine in early rheumatoid arthritis (HERA) 
      study.
PG  - 623-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the longterm effect of delaying therapy with second-line
      agents in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: One hundred
      nineteen patients who participated in a 9 month placebo controlled randomized
      trial of hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) were followed prospectively for an
      additional 3 years. Those randomized to HCQ are referred to as the early
      treatment group and those randomized to placebo as the delayed treatment group.
      Participants were assessed annually for pain [Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales
      (AIMS) and Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], physical disability
      (AIMS and HAQ), and the RA global well being scale (AIMS). Conversion of results 
      into standard deviation (SD) units permitted defining a substantial difference as
      per Felson as > 0.30 SD units and a clinically indistinguishable difference as < 
      or = 0.06 SD units. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen patients (97%) participated and 
      complete data were available on 104 (87%). Compared to the early treatment group,
      the delayed group remained worse for both the pain and the physical disability
      outcomes over the additional 3 year followup. The difference in the RA global
      well being score became clinically indistinguishable for the early and delayed
      groups only after the 2 year post-trial assessment. The between-group differences
      were not explained by post-trial therapy with corticosteroids, other second-line 
      agents, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and analgesic preparations.
      CONCLUSION: These findings show that a delay in instituting therapy with
      second-line agents, even a 9 month delay in instituting a moderately powerful
      second-line agent such as HCQ, has significant effects on longterm patient
      outcome, and provides strong evidence in support of early therapy in RA.

TI  - A program for relapse prevention in schizophrenia: a controlled study.
PG  - 277-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined whether a program for relapse prevention (PRP) is
      more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing relapse and
      rehospitalization rates among outpatients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Eighty-two
      outpatients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were
      randomly assigned to receive either PRP (experimental group, n = 41) or TAU
      (control group, n = 41) and were followed up for an 18-month prospective
      controlled study. Patients in both groups were prescribed standard doses of
      maintenance antipsychotic medication. Treatment with PRP consisted of a
      combination of psychoeducation, active monitoring for prodromal symptoms with
      clinical intervention when such symptoms occurred, weekly group therapy for
      patients, and multifamily groups. The TAU consisted of biweekly individual
      supportive therapy and medication management. RESULTS: Outcome rates over 18
      months were 17% for relapse (7 patients) and 22% for rehospitalization (9
      patients) in the PRP group, compared with 34% for relapse (14 patients) and 39%
      for rehospitalization (16 patients) in the TAU group (P = .01 and P = .03,
      respectively). Addition of age, sex, baseline Global Assessment Scale score,
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores (3 measures), and substance abuse to 
      the proportional hazards regression models all yielded nonsignificant effects.
      The PRP teams were much more likely than the TAU psychiatrists to identify
      prodromal episodes before patients met objective relapse criteria or needed
      hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The PRP was effective in detecting prodromal
      symptoms of relapse early in an episode. Crisis intervention including increased 
      antipsychotic medication use during the prodromal phase reduced relapse and
      rehospitalization rates.

TI  - Pravastatin reduces restenosis two years after percutaneous transluminal coronary
      angioplasty (REGRESS trial).
PG  - 742-6
AB  - The Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) is a placebo-controlled
      multicenter study designed to assess the effect of 2-year treatment with
      pravastatin on the progression and regression of angiographically documented
      coronary artery disease. One of the secondary end points was the occurrence of
      2-year restenosis in the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
      block. We randomly assigned eligible patients to receive pravastatin 40 mg once
      daily or placebo. The end point was the percent diameter stenosis of the target
      lesion at 24 months, as assessed by (semi)quantitative coronary angiography. Two 
      hundred twenty-one patients underwent scheduled PTCA, which was considered
      successful in 201 patients. One hundred seventy-eight patients underwent
      angiographic restudy (89%). The patients in the pravastatin group (n = 109) and
      placebo group (n = 112) were similar at baseline. Percent diameter stenosis
      before angioplasty was 78 +/- 14% (mean +/- SD) in the pravastatin group and 80
      +/- 14% in the placebo group (p = 0.46). At follow-up, the percent diameter
      stenosis was 32 +/- 23% in the pravastatin group and 45 +/- 29% in the placebo
      group (p < 0.001). Clinical restenosis was significantly lower in the pravastatin
      group (7%) compared with the placebo group (29%) (p < 0.001). Risk reduction for 
      all events was 58%. We conclude that treatment with pravastatin reduces 2-year
      clinical and angiographic restenosis.

TI  - An experimental evaluation of theory-based mother and mother-child programs for
      children of divorce.
PG  - 843-56
AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of 2 theory-based preventive interventions for 
      divorced families: a program for mothers and a dual component mother-child
      program. The mother program targeted mother-child relationship quality,
      discipline, interparental conflict, and the father-child relationship. The child 
      program targeted active coping, avoidant coping, appraisals of divorce stressors,
      and mother-child relationship quality. Families with a 9- to 12-year-old child (N
      = 240) were randomly assigned to the mother, dual-component, or self-study
      program. Postintervention comparisons showed significant positive program effects
      of the mother program versus self-study condition on relationship quality,
      discipline, attitude toward father-child contact, and adjustment problems. For
      several outcomes, more positive effects occurred in families with poorer initial 
      functioning. Program effects on externalizing problems were maintained at 6-month
      follow-up. A few additive effects of the dual-component program occurred for the 
      putative mediators; none occurred for adjustment problems.

TI  - Effects of nicotinamide and intravenous insulin therapy in newly diagnosed type 1
      diabetes.
PG  - 360-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of intravenous insulin therapy combined with
      nicotinamide in the metabolic control and beta-cell function of newly diagnosed
      type 1 diabetic subjects in comparison with intensive insulin therapy and
      nicotinamide alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 34 newly diagnosed
      type 1 diabetic patients were included. After the correction of initial metabolic
      disturbances, subjects were randomly assigned to the following three groups
      within 72 h after admission: 1) intensive insulin therapy + placebo (C) (n = 12);
      2) intensive insulin therapy + nicotinamide, 700 mg three times a day (NIC) (n = 
      11); and 3) 72-h intravenous insulin followed by intensive insulin therapy +
      nicotinamide, 700 mg three times a day (NIV) (n = 11). The subjects were
      monitored for 12 months. GAD, tyrosine phosphatase antibodies, and insulin
      autoantibodies were measured. C-peptide was measured basally and after 2, 4, 6,
      8, and 10 min of 1 mg intravenous glucagon. HbA1c, glucagon, and antibody
      measurements were determined initially and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. RESULTS:
      HbA1c values declined to normal after treatment was initiated in all groups and
      remained not significantly different during the follow-up period. We did not find
      differences between experimental (NIC and NIV) and placebo (C) groups in terms of
      beta-cell function, considering basal or glucagon-stimulated C-peptide (maximal
      stimulated C-peptide and area under the curve [AUC] of C-peptide) values during
      the follow-up period. After pooling data from the NIC and NIV groups (both
      including nicotinamide) and comparing it with data from the C group, the results 
      remained unchanged. At diagnosis, GAD positivity was observed in 10 of 12, 8 of
      11, and 10 of 11 subjects (NS) in the C, NIC, and NIV groups, respectively, and
      IA2 positivity was observed in 3 of 12, 4 of 11, and 4 of 11 subjects (NS) in the
      C, NIC, and NIV groups, respectively. Antibody titers displayed a similar
      behavior in all groups during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study 
      failed to demonstrate that the addition of 72-h intravenous insulin and
      nicotinamide to conventional intensive insulin therapy produces any beneficial
      effect in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic subjects in terms of beta-cell function
      and metabolic control.

TI  - Resuscitation of critically ill patients based on the results of gastric
      tonometry: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 607-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether additional therapy aimed at correcting low
      gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) improves outcome in conventionally resuscitated,
      critically ill patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study.
      SETTING: General intensive care unit (ICU) of a university teaching hospital.
      PATIENTS: A total of 210 adult patients, with a median Acute Physiology and
      Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 24 (range, 8-51). INTERVENTIONS: All
      patients were resuscitated according to standard guidelines. After resuscitation,
      those patients in the intervention group with a pHi of <7.35 were treated with
      additional colloid and then dobutamine (5 microg/kg/min then 10 microg/kg min)
      until 24 hrs after enrollment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were no
      significant differences (p > .05) in ICU mortality (39.6% in the control group
      vs. 38.5% in the intervention group), hospital mortality (45.3% in the control
      group vs. 42.3% in the intervention group), and 30-day mortality (43.7% in the
      control group vs. 40.2 in the intervention group); survival curves; median
      modified maximal multiorgan dysfunction score (10 points in the control group vs.
      13 points in the intervention group); median modified duration of ICU stay (12
      days in the control group vs. 11.5 days in the intervention group); or median
      modified duration of hospital stay (60 days in the control group vs. 42 days in
      the intervention group). A subgroup analysis of those patients with gastric
      mucosal pH of > or =7.35 at admission revealed no difference in ICU mortality
      (10.3% in the control group vs. 14.8% in the intervention group), hospital
      mortality (13.8% in the control group vs. 29.6% in the intervention group), or
      30-day mortality (10.3% in the control group vs. 26.9% in the intervention
      group). CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of treatment titrated against pHi in the
      management of critically ill patients cannot be supported. Failure to improve
      outcome may be caused by an inability to produce a clinically significant change 
      in pHi or because pHi is simply a marker of disease rather than a factor in the
      pathogenesis of multiorgan failure.

TI  - Randomized, dose-escalation study of SD/01 compared with daily filgrastim in
      patients receiving chemotherapy.
PG  - 2522-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the use of SD/01 (a polyethylene glycol-conjugated filgrastim
      shown in preclinical studies to have a prolonged half-life) in patients with
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with
      non-small-cell lung cancer were randomized to receive daily filgrastim (5
      microg/kg/d) or a single injection of SD/01 (30, 100, or 300 microg/kg) 2 weeks
      before chemotherapy and again 24 hours after administration of carboplatin and
      paclitaxel. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and safety analyses were performed.
      RESULTS: Peak serum concentrations of SD/01 and the duration of increased serum
      concentrations were dependent on the SD/01 dose. SD/01 concentrations remained
      increased longer in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
      Prechemotherapy median absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) in patients receiving
      SD/01 were increased in a dose-dependent fashion, with the duration of this
      effect also being dose dependent. After chemotherapy, median ANC nadirs were
      similar in the filgrastim cohort and the cohort receiving SD/01 30 microg/kg,
      with higher nadirs seen in the cohorts receiving SD/01 100 or 300 microg/kg.
      Dose-limiting toxicities were not noted. CD34(+) cells were mobilized in all
      cohorts. CONCLUSION: A single dose of SD/01 increases the serum concentration of 
      SD/01 for several days in a dose-dependent fashion and is not associated with
      significant toxicity. The effects of SD/01 on ANC and CD34(+) cell mobilization
      are comparable or greater than those achieved with daily filgrastim. The
      self-regulation of this molecule provides a potential therapeutic advantage in a 
      variety of clinical settings associated with neutropenia.

TI  - Physiotherapy for anterior knee pain: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 700-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of the individual components of
      physiotherapy in subjects with anterior knee pain. METHODS: An observer blind,
      prospective, factorial design randomised controlled trial. 81 young adults with
      anterior knee pain were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: (1)
      exercise, taping, and education; (2) exercise and education; (3) taping and
      education; and (4) education alone. Each group received six physiotherapist-led
      treatments over three months. Follow up took place at three months using the
      following outcome measures: patient satisfaction (discharge/refer for further
      treatment); a visual analogue pain score; the WOMAC lower limb function score;
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD); and quadriceps strength. At 12
      months the WOMAC and HAD were assessed by postal questionnaire. RESULTS: All
      groups showed significant improvements in WOMAC, visual analogue, and HAD scores;
      these improvements did not vary significantly between the four groups or between 
      exercising/non-exercising and taped/non-taped patients at three and 12 months.
      However, patients who exercised were significantly more likely to be discharged
      at three months than non-exercising patients (chi(2), p<0.001). Taping was not
      significantly associated with discharge. Significantly greater improvements in
      WOMAC, visual analogue, and the anxiety score (but not the depression score) were
      seen in patients who were discharged than in those who were referred.
      CONCLUSIONS: The proprioceptive muscle stretching and strengthening aspects of
      physiotherapy have a beneficial effect at three months sufficient to permit
      discharge from physiotherapy. These benefits are maintained at one year. Taping
      does not influence the outcome.

      diary cards were analysed. INTERVENTIONS: Immunisation with 25 gauge, 16 mm,
      orange hub needle or 23 gauge, 25 mm, blue hub needle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Parental recordings of redness, swelling, and tenderness for three days after
      immunisation. RESULTS: Rate of redness with the longer needle was initially two
      thirds the rate with the smaller needle (relative risk 0.66 (95% confidence
      interval 0.45 to 0.99), P=0.04), and by the third day this had decreased to a
      seventh (relative risk 0.13 (0.03 to 0.56), P=0.0006). Rate of swelling with the 
      longer needle was initially about a third that with the smaller needle (relative 
      risk 0.39 (0.23 to 0.67), P=0.0002), and this difference remained for all three
      days. Rates of tenderness were also lower with the longer needle throughout
      follow up, but not significantly (relative risk 0.60 (0.29 to 1.25), P=0.17).
      CONCLUSIONS: Use of 25 mm needles significantly reduced rates of local reaction
      to routine infant immunisation. On average, for every five infants vaccinated,
      use of the longer needle instead of the shorter needle would prevent one infant
      from experiencing any local reaction. Vaccine manufacturers should review their
      policy of supplying the shorter needle in vaccine packs.

TI  - Low-dose nitric oxide therapy for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the
      newborn. Clinical Inhaled Nitric Oxide Research Group.
PG  - 469-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhaled nitric oxide improves gas exchange in neonates, but the
      efficacy of low-dose inhaled nitric oxide in reducing the need for extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation has not been established. METHODS: We conducted a clinical
      trial to determine whether low-dose inhaled nitric oxide would reduce the use of 
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in neonates with pulmonary hypertension who
      were born after 34 weeks' gestation, were 4 days old or younger, required
      assisted ventilation, and had hypoxemic respiratory failure as defined by an
      oxygenation index of 25 or higher. The neonates who received nitric oxide were
      treated with 20 ppm for a maximum of 24 hours, followed by 5 ppm for no more than
      96 hours. The primary end point of the study was the use of extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Of 248 neonates enrolled, 126 were randomly
      assigned to the nitric oxide group and 122 to the control group. Extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation was used in 78 neonates in the control group (64 percent)
      and in 48 neonates in the nitric oxide group (38 percent) (P=0.001). The 30-day
      mortality rate in the two groups was similar (8 percent in the control group and 
      7 percent in the nitric oxide group). Chronic lung disease developed less often
      in neonates treated with nitric oxide than in those in the control group (7
      percent vs. 20 percent, P=0.02). The efficacy of nitric oxide was independent of 
      the base-line oxygenation index and the primary pulmonary diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:
      Inhaled nitric oxide reduces the extent to which extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation is needed in neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure and
      pulmonary hypertension.

TI  - A comparison of cilostazol and pentoxifylline for treating intermittent
      claudication.
PG  - 523-30
AB  - PURPOSE: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      trial to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of cilostazol and
      pentoxifylline. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with
      moderate-to-severe claudication from 54 outpatient vascular clinics, including
      sites at Air Force, Veterans Affairs, tertiary care, and university medical
      centers in the United States. Of 922 consenting patients, 698 met the inclusion
      criteria and were randomly assigned to blinded treatment with either cilostazol
      (100 mg orally twice a day), pentoxifylline (400 mg orally 3 times a day), or
      placebo. We measured maximal walking distance with constant-speed, variable-grade
      treadmill testing at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks. RESULTS:
      Mean maximal walking distance of cilostazol-treated patients (n = 227) was
      significantly greater at every postbaseline visit compared with patients who
      received pentoxifylline (n = 232) or placebo (n = 239). After 24 weeks of
      treatment, mean maximal walking distance increased by a mean of 107 m (a mean
      percent increase of 54% from baseline) in the cilostazol group, significantly
      more than the 64-m improvement (a 30% mean percent increase) with pentoxifylline 
      (P <0.001). The improvement with pentoxifylline was similar (P = 0.82) to that in
      the placebo group (65 m, a 34% mean percent increase). Deaths and serious adverse
      event rates were similar in each group. Side effects (including headache,
      palpitations, and diarrhea) were more common in the cilostazol-treated patients, 
      but withdrawal rates were similar in the cilostazol (16%) and pentoxifylline
      (19%) groups. CONCLUSION: Cilostazol was significantly better than pentoxifylline
      or placebo for increasing walking distances in patients with intermittent
      claudication, but was associated with a greater frequency of minor side effects. 
      Pentoxifylline and placebo had similar effects.

TI  - Use of capsular polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine for type II group
      B Streptococcus in healthy women.
PG  - 1129-38
AB  - An estimated 15% of invasive group B streptococcal (GBS) disease is caused by
      type II capsular polysaccharide (II CPS). In developing a pentavalent vaccine for
      the prevention of GBS infections, individual GBS CPSs have been coupled to
      tetanus toxoid (TT) to prepare vaccines with enhanced immunogenicity. Type II GBS
      (GBS II) vaccine was created by direct, covalent coupling of II CPS to TT by
      reductive amination. In 2 clinical trials, 75 healthy nonpregnant women 18-45
      years old were randomized to receive II CPS-TT (II-TT) conjugate (dose range,
      3.6-57 microg of CPS component) or uncoupled II CPS vaccine. Both vaccines were
      well tolerated. II CPS-specific IgG serum concentrations (as well as IgM and IgA)
      peaked 2 weeks after immunization, being significantly higher in recipients of
      conjugated vaccine than in recipients of uncoupled CPS. Immunological responses
      to conjugate were dose dependent and correlated with opsonophagocytosis in vitro.
      These results support inclusion of II-TT conjugate when preparing a multivalent
      GBS vaccine.

TI  - Gender differences in treatment response to sertraline versus imipramine in
      chronic depression.
PG  - 1445-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined gender differences in treatment response to
      sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and to imipramine, a
      tricyclic antidepressant, in chronic depression. METHOD: A total of 235 male and 
      400 female outpatients with DSM-III-R chronic major depression or double
      depression (i.e., major depression superimposed on dysthymia) were randomly
      assigned to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with sertraline or with imipramine
      after placebo washout. RESULTS: Women were significantly more likely to show a
      favorable response to sertraline than to imipramine, and men were significantly
      more likely to show a favorable response to imipramine than to sertraline. Gender
      and type of medication were also significantly related to dropout rates; women
      who were taking imipramine and men who were taking sertraline were more likely to
      withdraw from the study. Gender differences in time to response were seen with
      imipramine, with women responding significantly more slowly than men. Comparison 
      of treatment response rates by menopausal status showed that premenopausal women 
      responded significantly better to sertraline than to imipramine and that
      postmenopausal women had similar rates of response to the two medications.
      CONCLUSIONS: Men and women with chronic depression show differential responsivity
      to and tolerability of SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants. The differing
      response rates between the drug classes in women was observed primarily in
      premenopausal women. Thus, female sex hormones may enhance response to SSRIs or
      inhibit response to tricyclics. Both gender and menopausal status should be
      considered when choosing an appropriate antidepressant for a depressed patient.

TI  - Rabeprazole versus ranitidine for the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease: a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Raberprazole Study
      Group.
PG  - 1894-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 
      the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole to that of the histamine-2 (H2)-receptor
      antagonist ranitidine in the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal reflux
      disease. The primary indicator of efficacy was the absence of esophageal erosions
      or ulcerations as determined by posttreatment endoscopy. Secondary indicators of 
      efficacy included improvement in frequency and severity of daytime and nighttime 
      heartburn. METHODS: A total of 338 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned
      to therapy with rabeprazole 20 mg once daily in the morning or to ranitidine 150 
      mg four times daily. At baseline and at 4 wk, patients underwent endoscopy for
      evaluation of esophageal lesions. Patients whose lesions healed by wk 4 had
      therapy discontinued; others remained on therapy and had repeat endoscopy at 8
      wk. Also recorded at study visits were patients' ratings of heartburn symptoms
      and overall sense of well being, patients' reports of time lost from daily
      activities, antacid use, and adverse events. Serum gastrin levels were measured
      and argyrophil enterochromaffin-like cell histology evaluated at baseline and
      when the patient ended therapy. RESULTS: At wk 4, healing was observed in 59%
      (98/167) of patients assigned to rabeprazole therapy, compared with 36% (60/169) 
      of those receiving ranitidine (p < 0.001). By 8 wk, healing was seen in 87%
      (146/167) and 66% (112/169) of patients in the rabeprazole and ranitidine groups,
      respectively (p < 0.001). There were also significant differences between the two
      groups favoring rabeprazole with respect to resolution or improvement of
      heartburn symptoms and improvement in sense of well-being. No drug-related
      serious adverse events were seen with either therapy; fewer patients assigned to 
      rabeprazole had treatment-emergent signs and symptoms. Serum gastrin levels
      increased over baseline in the rabeprazole group, but the mean value remained
      within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: Rabeprazole was superior to ranitidine in
      esophageal healing and symptom relief in patients with erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease, and was equally well tolerated.

TI  - Identifying the indications for laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy: a
      prospective, randomised comparison with abdominal hysterectomy in patients with
      symptomatic uterine fibroids.
PG  - 620-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) and
      total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) in patients with uterine fibroids. DESIGN: A
      prospective randomised study. SETTING: The San Paolo Hospital, Milan. POPULATION:
      Sixty-two patients, who were not suitable for a vaginal hysterectomy, requiring
      treatment for uterine fibroids. METHODS: Randomisation between LAVH and TAH.
      Comparison of outcomes on the whole series, patients with uteri < or = 500 g
      (Group 1) and patients with uteri > 500 g (Group 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To
      establish operating time, blood loss, complications, febrile morbidity,
      analgesics administration and hospital stay for both treatment approaches.
      RESULTS: Median uterine weight was 400 g in both LAVH and TAH group. Median
      operating time was longer for LAVH (135 min compared with 120 min for TAH; P =
      0.001), but patients undergoing LAVH had less analgesics administration (23%
      compared with 77%, P < 0.001) and a shorter median hospital stay (3.8 compared
      with 5.8 days; P < 0.001). LAVH, when compared with TAH in the two weight
      subgroups, required a significantly longer operating time only in Group 2,
      significantly reduced analgesics administration only in Group 1, and
      significantly reduced hospital stay in both groups. Conversions of LAVH to
      laparotomy were significantly more frequent in Group 2 (3/11) than in Group 1
      (0/20) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with TAH, LAVH has advantages in
      removing uteri weighing < or = 500 g, with comparable operating time, less
      post-operative pain and shorter recovery. Among uteri weighing > 500 g LAVH
      showed a shorter recovery, but longer operating time than TAH and a 27% rate of
      conversion to laparotomy.

TI  - Randomized phase III study of temozolomide versus dacarbazine in the treatment of
      patients with advanced metastatic malignant melanoma.
PG  - 158-66
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare, in 305 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma,
      temozolomide and dacarbazine (DTIC) in terms of overall survival,
      progression-free survival (PFS), objective response, and safety, and to assess
      health-related quality of life (QOL) and pharmacokinetics of both drugs and their
      metabolite, 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboximide (MTIC). PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either oral temozolomide at a
      starting dosage of 200 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 28 days or intravenous (IV)
      DTIC at a starting dosage of 250 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 21 days. RESULTS: In 
      the intent-to-treat population, median survival time was 7.7 months for patients 
      treated with temozolomide and 6.4 months for those treated with DTIC (hazards
      ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.52). Median PFS time was
      significantly longer in the temozolomide-treated group (1.9 months) than in the
      DTIC-treated group (1.5 months) (P =.012; hazards ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07 to
      1.75). No major difference in drug safety was observed. Temozolomide was well
      tolerated and produced a noncumulative, transient myelosuppression late in the
      28-day cycle. The most common nonhematologic toxicities were mild to moderate
      nausea and vomiting, which were easily managed. Temozolomide therapy improved
      health-related QOL; more patients showed improvement or maintenance of physical
      functioning at week 12. Systemic exposure (area under the curve) to the parent
      drug and the active metabolite, MTIC, was higher after treatment with oral
      temozolomide than after IV administration of DTIC. CONCLUSION: Temozolomide
      demonstrates efficacy equal to that of DTIC and is an oral alternative for
      patients with advanced metastatic melanoma.

TI  - Ceruminolytic effects of docusate sodium: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 228-32
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the tympanic membrane is often impeded by the
      presence of cerumen. We compared the ceruminolytic effects of triethanolamine
      polypeptide and docusate sodium in patients with cerumen. METHODS: We conducted a
      prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial on a convenience sample
      of cooperative adult and pediatric patients presenting to a university-based
      emergency department who required removal of cerumen to visualize the tympanic
      membrane. Structured data collection was performed, and the physician determined 
      whether visualization of the tympanic membrane was partially or totally obscured 
      by cerumen (interobserver agreement, rho=0.79). Patients received intra-aural
      instillation of 1mL of either docusate sodium or triethanolamine polypeptide in a
      liquid form. If not completely cleared within 15 minutes, the external ear canal 
      was irrigated with 50 or 100 mL of normal saline solution and additional attempts
      to visualize the tympanic membrane were made. The main outcome was the proportion
      of ears in which the tympanic membrane could be totally visualized after
      ceruminolytic instillation with or without irrigation. This study had 80% power
      to detect a 40% difference between groups in the proportion of totally visualized
      tympanic membranes (chi(2) test, alpha=.05). RESULTS: Of 50 enrolled patients, 23
      received triethanolamine polypeptide and 27 received docusate sodium. Mean
      patient age was 40 years (range 1 to 81 years); 35% were female. Groups were
      similar in age, sex, and proportion of completely obscured tympanic membranes at 
      presentation (78%). The ability to completely visualize the tympanic membrane was
      significantly greater after treatment with docusate sodium versus triethanolamine
      polypeptide (81% versus 35%; difference in proportions 47%; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 22 to 71) particularly in children aged 5 or less (90% versus 0%; 
      difference in proportions 89%; 95% CI 50 to 100). CONCLUSION: Docusate sodium
      solution is a more effective ceruminolytic than triethanolamine polypeptide,
      allowing complete or partial visualization of the tympanic membrane in most
      patients after a single application when followed with irrigation. Use of
      docusate sodium as a ceruminolytic should be encouraged, particularly in
      children.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of the effect of needle gauge and local anaesthetic on 
      the pain of breast fine-needle aspiration cytology.
PG  - 777-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is an invasive
      investigation which can be uncomfortable or distressing. This randomized study
      investigated the discomfort of breast FNAC and the effect of different
      techniques. METHODS: Some 116 FNAC samples were taken from 98 women with a
      palpable breast mass. Each patient was randomized to one of four study groups;
      aspiration was performed using a green-hub (21 G) or blue-hub (23 G) needle,
      either with or without local anaesthetic. Each patient scored the pain of the
      whole procedure using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: A green-hub needle caused
      significantly more discomfort (mean(s.e.m.) pain score 5.1(0. 4) cm) than a
      blue-hub needle (2.9(0.4) cm), or either a blue- or green-hub needle with local
      anaesthetic (3.0(0.4) and 2.1(0.4) cm respectively) (F = 10.28, 3112 d.f., P <
      0.01, analysis of variance). CONCLUSION: The discomfort of breast FNAC is
      dependent upon the gauge of the needle and the use of local anaesthetic. A
      blue-hub needle without local anaesthetic should be first choice for breast FNAC.

TI  - Efficacy of the Ghajar Guide revisited: a prospective study.
PG  - 801-3
AB  - OBJECT: The goal of this study was to compare the freehand technique of catheter 
      placement using external landmarks with the technique of using the Ghajar Guide
      for this procedure. The placement of a ventricular catheter can be a lifesaving
      procedure, and it is commonly performed by all neurosurgeons. Various methods
      have been described to cannulate the ventricular system, including the modified
      Friedman tunnel technique in which a soft polymeric tube is inserted through a
      burr hole. Paramore, et al., have noted that two thirds of noninfectious
      complications have been related to incorrect positioning of the catheter.
      METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients were randomized between either freehand 
      or Ghajar Guide-assisted catheter placement. The target was the foramen of Monro,
      and the course was through the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle
      approximately 10 cm above the nasion, 3 cm from the midline, to a depth of 5.5 cm
      from the inner table of the skull. In all cases, the number of passes was
      recorded for successful cannulation, and pre- and postplacement computerized
      tomography scans were obtained. Calculations were performed to determine the
      bicaudate index and the distance from the catheter tip to the target point.
      CONCLUSIONS: Successful cannulation was achieved using either technique; however,
      the catheters placed using the Ghajar Guide were closer to the target.

TI  - Prevention of deep abdominal complications with omentoplasty on the raw surface
      after hepatic resection. The French Associations for Surgical Research.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several methods have been suggested to treat the hepatic raw surface 
      after resection. Among these, omentoplasty (OP) has been employed occasionally
      but there are no clinical studies that clearly demonstrate its usefulness.
      METHODS: Of 172 randomized patients undergoing hepatic resection between January 
      1991 and December 1994, 5 were withdrawn for protocol violation, leaving 167 who 
      were randomly allotted to undergo OP (n = 87) on the hepatic raw surface or not
      (NO; n = 80). This procedure was performed for malignant tumor in 125 cases,
      benign tumor in 33, and for other causes in 15. Six patients had more than two
      types of lesions, and 32 patients had associated cirrhosis. Sixty-five major and 
      102 minor hepatic resections were performed. The main outcome measures studied
      were the number of patients with deep abdominal complications (DAC; deep bleeding
      or hematoma, deep infection, with or without pus discharge through drains, bile
      leakage), as well as repeat operations and postoperative death. Patients were
      divided into two strata according to the site of the lesion with respect to the
      diaphragm: (1) in contact (posterosuperior segments II, VII and VIII) or (2) not 
      in contact (anterior segments III, IV, V, and VI). RESULTS: Both groups were
      comparable as regards patient demographics, intraoperative procedures,
      intraoperative search for bile leaks and intraoperative transfusion requirements.
      Fewer patients had DAC in OP (n = 11) than in NO (n = 15) (difference not
      significant). Ten patients (6%) required repeat operations: 4 in OP without
      immediate mortality and 6 in NO, 3 followed by death. One further patient in OP
      required repeat operation after discharge and died. Four patients died in OP and 
      7 in NO, 1 and 4 of DAC, respectively (not significant). Deep abdominal
      complications were significantly associated with major hepatic resection (P
      <0.05) whereas postoperative death was significantly correlated with cirrhosis (P
      <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: OP on the raw surface after hepatic resection lowers the
      rate of all complications related to DAC (except biliary leaks) and their
      severity (repeat operations and death) but not significantly so. OP is not
      recommended as a routine measure to complete elective hepatic resections.

TI  - Predictors of outcome in a primary care depression trial.
PG  - 859-67
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous treatment trials have found that approximately one third of
      depressed patients have persistent symptoms. We examined whether depression
      severity, comorbid psychiatric illness, and personality factors might play a role
      in this lack of response. DESIGN: Randomized trial of a stepped collaborative
      care intervention versus usual care. SETTING: HMO in Seattle, Wash. PATIENTS:
      Patients with major depression were stratified into severe (N = 149) and mild to 
      moderate depression (N = 79) groups prior to randomization. INTERVENTIONS: A
      multifaceted intervention targeting patient, physician, and process of care,
      using collaborative management by a psychiatrist and primary care physician.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with more severe depression had a higher 
      risk for panic disorder (odds ratio [OR], 5.8), loneliness (OR, 2.6), and
      childhood emotional abuse (OR, 2.1). Among those with less severe depression,
      intervention patients showed significantly improved depression outcomes over time
      compared with those in usual care (z = -3.06, P<.002); however, this difference
      was not present in the more severely depressed groups (z = 0.61, NS). Although
      the group with severe depression showed differences between the intervention and 
      control groups from baseline to 3 months that were similar to the group with less
      severe depression (during the acute phase of the intervention), these differences
      disappeared by 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Initial depression severity, comorbid panic
      disorder, and other psychosocial vulnerabilities were associated with a decreased
      response to the collaborative care intervention. Although the intervention was
      appropriate for patients with moderate depression, individuals with higher levels
      of depression may require a longer continuation phase of therapy in order to
      achieve optimal depression outcomes.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of lithium on cognition
      in healthy subjects: mild and selective effects on learning.
PG  - 147-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown cognitive impairment in short-term memory,
      long-term memory and psychomotor speed in bipolar patients taking lithium. The
      aim of the study was to look at the effect of lithium in normal subjects (N=30)
      taking lithium for 3 weeks. A comprehensive battery was used to assess attention 
      and memory. METHODS: Subjects were randomized to double-blind treatment with
      either lithium (N=15) or placebo (N=15) for a 3-week period. Thirteen
      participants in the lithium group and 15 in the placebo group completed the
      study. The lithium and placebo were administered twice daily in doses varying
      from 1050 to 1950 mg (mean=1569 mg). The initial daily dose was calculated
      according to the Pepin formula to achieve a blood serum lithium level of about
      0.8 mmol/l. Cognitive performance (attention, memory) was assessed in each
      subjects during three periods, i.e. at baseline, after 3 weeks of lithium or
      placebo, and 2 weeks after discontinuation of study medication. RESULTS: In
      short-term memory tasks, the performance of subjects in the lithium group was
      worst 3 weeks after lithium treatment compared to 2 weeks after discontinuation. 
      In long-term memory, a significantly higher number of words was recalled by the
      placebo group but not the lithium group. CONCLUSIONS: Lithium may have an effect 
      on learning when long-term explicit memory test are administered repeatedly. It
      means that the practice effect when a subject performs the same task several
      times is less in the lithium-treated group than in the placebo group. This
      practice effect is related to the learning of a task.

TI  - Daily interruption of sedative infusions in critically ill patients undergoing
      mechanical ventilation.
PG  - 1471-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conous infusions of sedative drugs in the intensive care unit may
      prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation, prolong the length of stay in the
      intensive care unit and the hospital, impede efforts to perform daily neurologic 
      examinations, and increase the need for tests to assess alterations in mental
      status. Whether regular interruption of such infusions might accelerate recovery 
      is not known. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 128 
      adult patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation and continuous infusions
      of sedative drugs in a medical intensive care unit. In the intervention group,
      the sedative infusions were interrupted until the patients were awake, on a daily
      basis; in the control group, the infusions were interrupted only at the
      discretion of the clinicians in the intensive care unit. RESULTS: The median
      duration of mechanical ventilation was 4.9 days in the intervention group, as
      compared with 7.3 days in the control group (P=0.004), and the median length of
      stay in the intensive care unit was 6.4 days as compared with 9.9 days,
      respectively (P=0.02). Six of the patients in the intervention group (9 percent) 
      underwent diagnostic testing to assess changes in mental status, as compared with
      16 of the patients in the control group (27 percent, P=0.02). Complications
      (e.g., removal of the endotracheal tube by the patient) occurred in three of the 
      patients in the intervention group (4 percent) and four of the patients in the
      control group (7 percent, P=0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who are receiving
      mechanical ventilation, daily interruption of sedative-drug infusions decreases
      the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of stay in the intensive
      care unit.

TI  - Influence of resistance training volume and periodization on physiological and
      performance adaptations in collegiate women tennis players.
PG  - 626-33
AB  - Few data exist on the long-term adaptations to heavy resistance training in
      women. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of volume of
      resistance exercise on the development of physical performance abilities in
      competitive, collegiate women tennis players. Twenty-four tennis players were
      matched for tennis ability and randomly placed into one of three groups: a no
      resistance exercise control group, a periodized multiple-set resistance training 
      group, or a single-set circuit resistance training group. No significant changes 
      in body mass were observed in any of the groups throughout the entire training
      period. However, significant increases in fat-free mass and decreases in percent 
      body fat were observed in the periodized training group after 4, 6, and 9 months 
      of training. A significant increase in power output was observed after 9 months
      of training in the periodized training group only. One-repetition maximum
      strength for the bench press, free-weight shoulder press, and leg press increased
      significantly after 4, 6, and 9 months of training in the periodized training
      group, whereas the single-set circuit group increased only after 4 months of
      training. Significant increases in serve velocity were observed after 4 and 9
      months of training in the periodized training group, whereas no significant
      changes were observed in the single-set circuit group. These data demonstrate
      that sport-specific resistance training using a periodized multiple-set training 
      method is superior to low-volume single-set resistance exercise protocols in the 
      development of physical abilities in competitive, collegiate women tennis
      players.

TI  - Placebo-controlled trial of glycine added to clozapine in schizophrenia.
PG  - 826-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of high-dose
      oral glycine on positive and negative symptoms and cognitive function when added 
      to clozapine in adults with schizophrenia. METHOD: The authors conducted a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial of 60 g/day of glycine
      added to clozapine for 8 weeks in 30 adults with schizophrenia. Clinical ratings 
      were performed every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed the trial.
      Glycine augmentation of clozapine produced no statistically significant change in
      positive or negative symptoms or cognitive functioning. No subjects showed
      clinically significant worsening of clinical ratings. CONCLUSIONS: These data,
      combined with data from previous trials with D-cycloserine and glycine, suggest
      that agonists at the glycine site may be less effective when combined with
      clozapine than they are when combined with conventional antipsychotics.

TI  - Treatment of acute low back pain with the COX-2-selective anti-inflammatory drug 
      nimesulide: results of a randomized, double-blind comparative trial versus
      ibuprofen.
PG  - 1579-85
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized double-blind comparative trial.
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nimesulide, a
      cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective anti-inflammatory agent versus ibuprofen in
      patients with acute lumbosacral back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been more effective than
      placebo in patients with uncomplicated acute low back pain in previous randomized
      controlled trials. The efficacy and tolerability of a new COX-2-selective
      anti-inflammatory drug have not yet been established. METHODS: One hundred four
      patients aged 18-65 years with acute low back pain were enrolled. The patients
      were randomly allocated either to oral nimesulide (100 mg twice daily for 10
      days) or oral ibuprofen (600 mg three times daily for 10 days). Outcome measures 
      on a visual analog scale were an average of the pain intensity and the pain
      relief, stiffness in the back, functional status, and the results of physical
      examinations. All side effects were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: With both
      study therapies, there was a clear improvement in all measured parameters of the 
      pain and back function parameters measured from the third day of treatment
      onward. The patients' capacity for daily tasks, showed improvement in both groups
      (P < 0. 001), but a statistically significant difference was found between the
      two groups in favor of the nimesulide group (P < 0.05) after 10 days. Nimesulide 
      was more effective than ibuprofen in improved lateral bending measurements (P =
      0.026). Nimesulide and ibuprofen provided similar degrees of improvement in the
      modified Schober tests and in the pain intensity and back stiffness scores. More 
      gastrointestinal side effects were reported with ibuprofen than nimesulide, and
      the comparison showed a trend (P = 0.067). Ten side effects occurred in the
      nimesulide group in 7 (13%) patients and 13 in the ibuprofen group in 11 (21%)
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed that the COX-2-selective inhibitor
      nimesulide is an effective and well-tolerated agent for use in general practices 
      to treat acute low back pain. The incidence of gastrointestinal side effects
      seems to be lower with nimesulide than with ibuprofen.

TI  - Primary vaccination of infants with diphtheria-tetanus-acellular
      pertussis-hepatitis B virus- inactivated polio virus and Haemophilus influenzae
      type b vaccines given as either separate or mixed injections.
PG  - 304-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this open, multicenter, randomized trial was to evaluate
      the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a candidate combined
      diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-hepatitis B virus-inactivated polio virus 
      (DTaP-HBV-IPV) vaccine when given as either a mixed or as separate concomitant
      injections with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. STUDY DESIGN: A
      total of 359 subjects were randomized to receive either DTaP-HBV-IPV/Hib (mixed
      administration - 180 subjects) or DTaP-HBV-IPV + Hib (separate administration in 
      opposite limbs - 179 subjects) at 2, 3, and 4 months of age. RESULTS: After
      vaccination, seroprotective antibody concentrations against diphtheria, tetanus, 
      hepatitis B, and polio viruses and a high (> or = 97%) pertussis vaccine response
      were seen in almost all study participants. All subjects except one in the mixed 
      administration group had postvaccination Hib anti-PRP antibody concentrations >
      or = 0.15 microg/mL. Of subjects in the mixed and separate group, 77.2%
      (geometric mean antibody concentration, 2. 62 microg/mL) and 88.6% (geometric
      mean antibody concentration, 4.45 microg/mL) had Hib anti-PRP concentrations > or
      = 1 microg/mL, respectively. The addition of the Hib component to the 5-component
      vaccine did not increase the incidence of local or general reactions. CONCLUSION:
      Both administrations of the candidate vaccine were found to be safe, immunogenic,
      and well tolerated. Although anti-PRP geometric mean antibody concentrations and 
      the percent of subjects achieving the 1 microg/mL seroprotective level were lower
      after the mixed administration, they were in the range seen with monovalent Hib
      vaccines or with other DTaP-based/Hib combinations licensed in some European
      countries. Therefore both administrations have the potential to simplify
      childhood immunization.

TI  - Infliximab and methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-Tumor 
      Necrosis Factor Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant Therapy Study
      Group.
PG  - 1594-602
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neutralization of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) for three to
      six months reduces the symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the
      capacity of this approach to effect a more sustained benefit and its effect on
      joint damage are not known. METHODS: We treated 428 patients who had active
      rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy with placebo or infliximab, a
      chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, in intravenous doses of 3 or 10
      mg per kilogram of body weight every 4 or 8 weeks in combination with oral
      methotrexate for 54 weeks. We assessed clinical responses with use of the
      criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, the quality of life with a
      health-status questionnaire, and the effect on joint damage radiographically.
      RESULTS: The combination of infliximab and methotrexate was well tolerated and
      resulted in a sustained reduction in the symptoms and signs of rheumatoid
      arthritis that was significantly greater than the reduction associated with
      methotrexate therapy alone (clinical response, 51.8 percent vs. 17.0 percent;
      P<0.001). The quality of life was also significantly better with infliximab plus 
      methotrexate than with methotrexate alone. Radiographic evidence of joint damage 
      increased in the group given methotrexate, but not in the groups given infliximab
      and methotrexate (mean change in radiographic score, 7.0 vs. 0.6, P<0.001).
      Radiographic evidence of progression of joint damage was absent in
      infliximab-treated patients whether or not they had a clinical response.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistently active rheumatoid arthritis despite
      methotrexate therapy, repeated doses of infliximab in combination with
      methotrexate provided clinical benefit and halted the progression of joint
      damage.

TI  - The protective effect of salbutamol inhaled using different devices on
      methacholine bronchoconstriction.
PG  - 1319-23
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the protective effect of salbutamol, 100 microg,
      inhaled by different devices (pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI; Ventolin;
      GlaxoWellcome; Greenford, UK], pMDI + spacer [Volumatic; GlaxoWellcome], or
      breath-activated pMDI [Autohaler; 3M Pharmaceuticals; St. Paul, MN]) on
      bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind,
      cross-over, placebo-controlled study. PATIENTS: Eighteen subjects with stable,
      moderate asthma, asymptomatic, receiving regular treatment with salmeterol, 50
      microg bid, and inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate, 250 microg bid, in the last 
      6 months, with high hyperreactivity to methacholine (baseline provocative dose of
      methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) [PD(20)] geometric mean [GM], 0.071
      mg). Subjects were classified into two groups: subjects with incorrect (n = 5)
      pMDI inhalation technique, and subjects with correct (n = 13) inhalation
      technique. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: After cessation of therapy for 3 days, all
      subjects underwent four methacholine challenge tests, each test 1 week apart,
      each time 15 min after inhalation of salbutamol, 100 microg (via pMDI, pMDI +
      spacer, or Autohaler), or placebo. The protective effect on methacholine
      challenge test was evaluated as the change in the PD(20), and expressed in terms 
      of doubling doses of methacholine in comparison with placebo treatment. RESULTS: 
      The PD(20) was significantly higher after salbutamol inhalation than after
      placebo inhalation, but no significant difference was observed among the three
      different inhalation techniques. Only when salbutamol was inhaled via pMDI +
      spacer, PD(20) was slightly but not significantly higher (pMDI GM, 0.454 mg; pMDI
      + spacer GM, 0.559 mg; and Autohaler GM, 0.372 mg; not significant [NS]) than
      other inhalation techniques. Similar results (mean +/-SEM) were obtained with
      doubling doses of methacholine (pMDI, 2 +/- 0.47; pMDI + spacer, 3 +/- 0.35; and 
      Autohaler, 2.4 +/- 0.40; NS). No significant difference was found among
      techniques when subjects with correct or incorrect inhalation technique were
      separately considered. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the protective effect of
      salbutamol, 100 microg, on methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction is not
      affected by the different inhalation techniques, although inhalation via pMDI +
      spacer tends to improve the bronchoprotective ability of salbutamol. These data
      confirm the clinical efficacy of salbutamol, whatever the device, and the
      patient's inhalation technique.

TI  - Intravenous clodronate in the treatment of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome.
      A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study.
PG  - 1477-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous (i.v.) clodronate in patients 
      with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) and to assess the urinary
      excretion of type I collagen crosslinked N-telopeptide (NTx) before and after the
      treatment. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with RSDS were randomized to receive
      either i.v. clodronate 300 mg daily for 10 consecutive days or placebo. Forty
      days later, the placebo treated patients received the clodronate treatment.
      Outcome measures included as a primary endpoint the visual analog scale of pain
      (VAS, range 0-100); secondary endpoints were a clinical global assessment (CGA,
      range 0-3) and an efficacy verbal score (EVS, range 0-3). Clinical and
      biochemical assessments were performed before the treatment, 40 (T40), 90 (T90), 
      and 180 (T180) days later. RESULTS: At T40 the 15 patients randomized to
      clodronate treatment showed significant decreases of VAS and CGA (p = 0.002, p = 
      0.001, respectively). Compared with the placebo group (17 patients), significant 
      differences were found in all clinical variables (VAS: p = 0.001; CGA: p = 0.001;
      EVS: p<0.0001). A further clinical improvement was observed throughout the study.
      Pooling the results of all 32 patients after clodronate treatment, at T180 the
      overall percentage decrease of VAS was 93.2+/-15.6%, with 30 patients
      significantly improved or asymptomatic. Significant inverse correlations between 
      baseline NTx values and decreases of VAS were found at T90 (p = 0.03) and T180 (p
      = 0.01). No adverse events related to treatment occurred. CONCLUSION: A 10 day
      i.v. clodronate course is better than placebo and effective in the treatment of
      RSDS. NTx seems to be a predictive factor for clodronate efficacy.

TI  - Prospective randomized trial comparing pressure-controlled ventilation and
      volume-controlled ventilation in ARDS. For the Spanish Lung Failure Collaborative
      Group.
PG  - 1690-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare in-hospital mortality of patients with ARDS
      ventilated with either pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) or volume-controlled
      ventilation (VCV) with a square-wave inspiratory flow. DESIGN: : Multicenter and 
      randomized trial. SETTING: Twelve medical-surgical ICUs located in tertiary-care 
      hospitals. PATIENTS: Seventy-nine patients having ARDS, as defined by the
      American-European Consensus Conference. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly
      assigned to be ventilated with either PCV (n = 37) or VCV (n = 42). In both
      instances, inspiratory plateau pressure was limited to < or = 35 cm H(2)O.
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the studied
      groups at the moment of randomization, although there was a trend toward greater 
      renal failure in patients assigned to VCV. Ventilatory settings and blood gases
      did not significantly differ over time between the two groups. Patients in the
      VCV group had both a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate than those
      in the PCV group (78% vs 51%, respectively) and a higher number of extrapulmonary
      organ failures (median, 4 vs 2, respectively). The development of renal failure
      during the study period was also significantly more frequent among VCV patients
      (64% vs 32%, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that factors
      independently associated with an increased mortality rate were the presence of
      two or more extrapulmonary organ failures (odds ratio [OR], 4.61; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 1.38 to 15.40) and acute renal failure (OR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.10 to 
      14.28) but not the ventilatory mode used. CONCLUSIONS: The increased number of
      extrapulmonary organ failures developed in patients of the VCV group was strongly
      associated with a higher mortality rate. The development of organ failures was
      probably not related to the ventilatory mode.

TI  - Postmenopausal hormone therapy increases risk for venous thromboembolic disease. 
      The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study.
PG  - 689-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptive use increases risk for venous thromboembolism, but
      data on the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy are limited. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine the effect of therapy with estrogen plus progestin on risk for venous
      thromboembolic events in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: 20 clinical centers in the United States.
      PARTICIPANTS: 2763 postmenopausal women younger than 80 years of age (mean age,
      67 years) who had coronary heart disease but no previous venous thromboembolism
      and had not had a hysterectomy. INTERVENTION: Conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 
      mg, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg, in one tablet (n = 1380) or placebo
      that was identical in appearance (n = 1383). MEASUREMENTS: Documented deep venous
      thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: During an average of 4.1 years of
      follow-up, 34 women in the hormone therapy group and 13 in the placebo group
      experienced venous thromboembolic events (relative hazard, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.4 to
      5.0] [P = 0.003]; excess risk, 3.9 per 1000 woman-years [CI, 1.4 to 6.4 per 1000 
      woman-years]; number needed to treat for harm, 256 [CI, 157 to 692]). In
      multivariate analysis, the risk for venous thromboembolism was increased among
      women who had lower-extremity fractures (relative hazard, 18.1 [CI, 5.4 to 60.4])
      or cancer (relative hazard, 3.9 [CI, 1.6 to 9.4]) and for 90 days after inpatient
      surgery (relative hazard, 4.9 [CI, 2.4 to 9.8]) or nonsurgical hospitalization
      (relative hazard, 5.7 [CI, 3.0 to 10.8]). Risk was decreased with aspirin
      (relative hazard, 0.5 [CI, 0.2 to 0.8]) or statin use (relative hazard, 0.5 [CI, 
      0.2 to 0.9]). CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal therapy with estrogen plus progestin
      increases risk for venous thromboembolism in women with coronary heart disease.
      This risk should be considered when the risks and benefits of therapy are being
      weighed.

TI  - Triphasic norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol for treating dysfunctional uterine
      bleeding.
PG  - 913-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a triphasic combination oral contraceptive 
      (OC) containing norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (E2) and placebo in the
      treatment of metrorrhagic, menometrorrhagic, oligomenorrheic, and polymenorrheic 
      dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized,
      double-masked study, 201 women (15-50 years of age) with DUB received triphasic
      norgestimate-ethinyl E2 or placebo, for three consecutive 28-day treatment
      cycles. Efficacy was determined by evaluating investigator and subject
      assessments of DUB resolution, abnormal uterine bleeding patterns during an
      84-day reference period, and change from baseline in subjects' quality of life.
      The sample size was based on the assumption that the proportions of subjects
      exhibiting treatment success (percentage of subjects with investigator and
      subject overall assessments of DUB resolution of "improved") were 65% for the
      active group and 40% for the placebo group (alpha = 0.05, 1 - beta = 0.80).
      RESULTS: More than 80% of subjects receiving triphasic norgestimate-ethinyl E2
      had improvements in their abnormal bleeding patterns as assessed by
      investigators, and the subjects themselves compared with fewer than 50% of
      subjects in the placebo treatment group (P <.001). Abnormal bleeding patterns
      were reported by significantly fewer subjects receiving triphasic
      norgestimate-ethinyl E2 than in the placebo treatment group (P <. 001). Change
      from baseline in physical functioning (eg, self-care, walking, lifting,
      exercising) was significantly more improved in the triphasic norgestimate-ethinyl
      E2 group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The triphasic combination of
      norgestimate and ethinyl E2 is an effective treatment for metrorrhagic,
      menometrorrhagic, oligomenorrheic, and polymenorrheic dysfunctional uterine
      bleeding.

TI  - Therapy focused on lowering postprandial glucose, not fasting glucose, may be
      superior for lowering HbA1c. IOEZ Study Group.
PG  - 1236-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall efficacy of combination therapies focused on
      fasting or postprandial blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes not
      adequately controlled with oral sulfonylurea agents alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: A total of 135 patients were randomly assigned for 3 months to 1 of 3
      combination regimens with glyburide (G) that addressed postprandial blood glucose
      with insulin lispro (L+G), premeal blood glucose with metformin (M+G), or fasting
      blood glucose (FBG) with bedtime NPH insulin (NPH+G). RESULTS: At end point,
      HbA1c was significantly lower with all therapies (P = 0.001) and was
      significantly lower for L+G (7.68+/-0.88%) compared with either NPH+G
      (8.51+/-1.38%, P = 0.003) or M+G (8.31+/-1.31%, P = 0.025). FBG at end point was 
      significantly lower for NPH+G (8.49+/-2.36 mmol/l) compared with either L+G
      (10.57+/-1.97 mmol/l, P = 0.001) or M+G (9.69+/-2.89 mmol/l, P = 0.029). The mean
      2-h postprandial glucose after a test meal was significantly lower for L+G
      (10.87+/-2.88 mmol/l) versus NPH+G (12.21+/-3.12 mmol/, P = 0.052) or versus M+G 
      (12.72+/-3.26 mmol/l, P = 0.009). The overall rate of hypoglycemia (episodes per 
      30 days) was low and not statistically significant between groups (P = 0.156).
      CONCLUSIONS: Adding a second antihyperglycemic agent, regardless of its timing of
      action, lowers HbA1c and glucose values. However, when insulin lispro was used to
      focus on postprandial blood glucose, there was a greater impact on overall
      metabolic control. These data support the importance of lowering postprandial
      blood glucose to optimize overall glycemic control and thus improve long-term
      outcomes.

TI  - Stapling procedure for haemorrhoids versus Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy:
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 782-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical haemorrhoidectomy has a reputation for being a painful
      procedure for a fairly benign disorder. The circular transanal stapled technique 
      for the treatment of haemorrhoids has the potential to offer a less painful
      rectal procedure in place of ablative perianal surgery. We compared the
      short-term outcome of the circular stapled procedure for haemorrhoids with
      current standard surgery in a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: 40 patients
      admitted for surgical treatment of prolapsing haemorrhoids were randomly assigned
      to Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy (n=20) or the circular stapled procedure.
      Under general anaesthesia patients underwent standardised diathermy excision
      haemorrhoidectomy or had a circumferential doughnut of rectal mucosa and
      submucosa above the dentate line excised and closed with a standard circular
      end-to-end stapling device. All patients received standardised preoperative and
      postoperative analgesic and laxative regimens. Patients completed linear analogue
      pain charts each day and were interviewed at 1, 3, and 6-10 weeks
      postoperatively. Summary measures of average pain experience were calculated from
      10 cm linear analogue pain scores and were used as the primary outcome measure.
      FINDINGS: The stapled group had shorter anaesthesia time (median 18 [range 9-25] 
      vs 22 [15-35] mins). Average pain in the stapled group was significantly lower
      than it was in the Milligan-Morgan group (2.1 [0.2-7.6] vs 6.5 [3.1-8.5], 95.1%
      CI difference medians 1.9-4.7, p<0.0001. Mann-Whitney U test). Average pain
      relative to what the patient expected was also significantly less in the stapled 
      group (-2.8 [-4.4 to 1.3] vs 0.7 [-1.8 to 3.4]. Hospital stay and time to first
      bowel motion were not significantly different between groups. Return to normal
      activity was significantly shorter in the stapled group (17 [3-60] vs 34 [14-90].
      Early and late complications, patient-assessed symptom control, and functional
      outcome appear similar after short-term follow-up. INTERPRETATION: The circular
      stapled technique offers a significantly less painful alternative to
      Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy and is associated with an earlier return to
      normal activity. Early symptom control and functional outcome appear similar.
      However, long-term symptomatic and functional outcome need further study.

TI  - Paroxetine versus amitriptyline for treatment of depression associated with
      rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized, double blind, parallel group study.
PG  - 2791-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine (a selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor) with that of amitriptyline (a tricyclic
      antidepressant) in the treatment of depression in 191 patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). METHODS: A randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group
      study. A placebo washout period of 3-7 days was followed by an 8 week active
      treatment phase during which patients received either paroxetine (20-40 mg daily)
      or amitriptyline (75-150 mg daily). The primary efficacy variable was the change 
      from baseline in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at endpoint.
      RESULTS: Paroxetine was as effective as amitriptyline for the treatment of
      depression, with similar improvements in RA associated pain and disability also
      seen in both groups. However, paroxetine was better tolerated than amitriptyline,
      with an overall frequency of adverse experiences of 56.4% and 67.7% in the 2
      groups, respectively. The frequency of anticholinergic adverse experiences was
      much lower in the paroxetine treatment group (18.1% vs 43.8% taking
      amitriptyline) and paroxetine treated patients also experienced fewer severe
      (16.0% vs 21.9%), serious nonfatal (0% vs 4.2%), and drug related adverse
      experiences (12.8% vs 29.2%). CONCLUSION: Tolerability is an important
      consideration in this patient population, which is largely composed of elderly
      patients who are taking additional medications for RA. Paroxetine shows a number 
      of advantages in the management of depression comorbid with RA.

TI  - Gender differences in treatment response to sertraline versus imipramine in
      chronic depression.
PG  - 1445-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined gender differences in treatment response to
      sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and to imipramine, a
      tricyclic antidepressant, in chronic depression. METHOD: A total of 235 male and 
      400 female outpatients with DSM-III-R chronic major depression or double
      depression (i.e., major depression superimposed on dysthymia) were randomly
      assigned to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with sertraline or with imipramine
      after placebo washout. RESULTS: Women were significantly more likely to show a
      favorable response to sertraline than to imipramine, and men were significantly
      more likely to show a favorable response to imipramine than to sertraline. Gender
      and type of medication were also significantly related to dropout rates; women
      who were taking imipramine and men who were taking sertraline were more likely to
      withdraw from the study. Gender differences in time to response were seen with
      imipramine, with women responding significantly more slowly than men. Comparison 
      of treatment response rates by menopausal status showed that premenopausal women 
      responded significantly better to sertraline than to imipramine and that
      postmenopausal women had similar rates of response to the two medications.
      CONCLUSIONS: Men and women with chronic depression show differential responsivity
      to and tolerability of SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants. The differing
      response rates between the drug classes in women was observed primarily in
      premenopausal women. Thus, female sex hormones may enhance response to SSRIs or
      inhibit response to tricyclics. Both gender and menopausal status should be
      considered when choosing an appropriate antidepressant for a depressed patient.

      of cooperative adult and pediatric patients presenting to a university-based
      emergency department who required removal of cerumen to visualize the tympanic
      membrane. Structured data collection was performed, and the physician determined 
      whether visualization of the tympanic membrane was partially or totally obscured 
      by cerumen (interobserver agreement, rho=0.79). Patients received intra-aural
      instillation of 1mL of either docusate sodium or triethanolamine polypeptide in a
      liquid form. If not completely cleared within 15 minutes, the external ear canal 
      was irrigated with 50 or 100 mL of normal saline solution and additional attempts
      to visualize the tympanic membrane were made. The main outcome was the proportion
      of ears in which the tympanic membrane could be totally visualized after
      ceruminolytic instillation with or without irrigation. This study had 80% power
      to detect a 40% difference between groups in the proportion of totally visualized
      tympanic membranes (chi(2) test, alpha=.05). RESULTS: Of 50 enrolled patients, 23
      received triethanolamine polypeptide and 27 received docusate sodium. Mean
      patient age was 40 years (range 1 to 81 years); 35% were female. Groups were
      similar in age, sex, and proportion of completely obscured tympanic membranes at 
      presentation (78%). The ability to completely visualize the tympanic membrane was
      significantly greater after treatment with docusate sodium versus triethanolamine
      polypeptide (81% versus 35%; difference in proportions 47%; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 22 to 71) particularly in children aged 5 or less (90% versus 0%; 
      difference in proportions 89%; 95% CI 50 to 100). CONCLUSION: Docusate sodium
      solution is a more effective ceruminolytic than triethanolamine polypeptide,
      allowing complete or partial visualization of the tympanic membrane in most
      patients after a single application when followed with irrigation. Use of
      docusate sodium as a ceruminolytic should be encouraged, particularly in
      children.

TI  - Noninvasive ventilation for treatment of acute respiratory failure in patients
      undergoing solid organ transplantation: a randomized trial.
PG  - 235-41
AB  - CONTEXT: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been associated with lower rates of
      endotracheal intubation in populations of patients with acute respiratory
      failure. OBJECTIVE: To compare NIV with standard treatment using supplemental
      oxygen administration to avoid endotracheal intubation in recipients of solid
      organ transplantation with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. DESIGN AND
      SETTING: Prospective randomized study conducted at a 14-bed, general intensive
      care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Of 238 patients who underwent solid
      organ transplantation from December 1995 to October 1997, 51 were treated for
      acute respiratory failure. Of these, 40 were eligible and 20 were randomized to
      each group. INTERVENTION: Noninvasive ventilation vs standard treatment with
      supplemental oxygen administration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The need for
      endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation at any time during the study, 
      complications not present on admission, duration of ventilatory assistance,
      length of hospital stay, and intensive care unit mortality. RESULTS: The 2 groups
      were similar at study entry. Within the first hour of treatment, 14 patients
      (70%) in the NIV group, and 5 patients (25%) in the standard treatment group
      improved their ratio of the PaO2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2). Over 
      time, a sustained improvement in PaO2 to FIO2 was noted in 12 patients (60%) in
      the NIV group, and in 5 patients (25%) randomized to standard treatment (P =
      .03). The use of NIV was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of
      endotracheal intubation (20% vs 70%; P = .002), rate of fatal complications (20% 
      vs 50%; P = .05), length of stay in the intensive care unit by survivors (mean
      [SD] days, 5.5 [3] vs 9 [4]; P = .03), and intensive care unit mortality (20% vs 
      50%; P = .05). Hospital mortality did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      indicate that transplantation programs should consider NIV in the treatment of
      selected recipients of transplantation with acute respiratory failure.

TI  - Effects of dextroamphetamine on depression and fatigue in men with HIV: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 436-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: This report documents findings from a small placebo-controlled trial 
      of dextroamphetamine for depression and fatigue in men with the human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Dextroamphetamine offers the potential for rapid
      onset of effect and activation properties, both of which are important to persons
      with medical illness and an uncertain, but limited, life expectancy. METHOD:
      Primary inclusion criteria included the presence of a DSM-IV depressive disorder,
      debilitating fatigue, and no history of dependence on stimulants. The study
      consisted of a 2-week randomized, placebo-controlled trial, with the blind
      maintained until week 8 for responders, followed by open treatment through the
      completion of 6 months. RESULTS: Of 23 men who entered the study, 22 completed
      the 2-week trial. Intent-to-treat analysis indicated that 73% of patients (8/11) 
      randomly assigned to dextroamphetamine reported significant improvement in mood
      and energy, compared with 25% (3/12) among placebo patients (Fisher exact test, p
      < .05). Both clinician- and self-administered measures indicated significantly
      improved mood, energy, and quality of life among patients taking
      dextroamphetamine. There was no evidence of the development of tolerance of,
      abuse of, or dependence on the medication. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that
      dextroamphetamine is a potentially effective, fast-acting antidepressant
      treatment for HIV patients with depression and debilitating fatigue.

TI  - Antiasthmatic effects of mediator blockade versus topical corticosteroids in
      allergic rhinitis and asthma.
PG  - 1297-301
AB  - To compare the antiasthmatic efficacy of inflammatory mediator blockade versus
      topical corticosteroid therapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) 
      and asthma, 14 patients were enrolled into a single-blind, double-dummy,
      placebo-controlled crossover study comparing 2 wk therapy of (1) 400 microgram
      orally inhaled budesonide plus 200 microgram intranasal budesonide (BUD) or (2)
      10 mg oral montelukast plus 10 mg oral cetirizine (ML + CZ). Before each
      treatment period, patients received 7 to 10 d placebo washout. All treatments
      were given once daily in the morning. Throughout the study, patients recorded the
      following domiciliary measures: peak expiratory flow (PEF), rescue inhaler
      requirement, asthma symptoms, and daily activity score. Laboratory measurements
      were made at trough of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) bronchial challenge and
      exhaled nitric oxide (NO). Compared with pooled placebo (PL), there were
      significant (p < 0.05) improvements in all domiciliary measures with both
      treatments (mean PEF [L/min] PL: 463; BUD: 478; ML + CZ: 483). For geometric mean
      AMP PC(20) (mg/ml), there was an improvement (p < 0.05), compared with PL (47),
      for ML + CZ (133) but not for BUD (51); whereas for NO (ppb) there was
      significant suppression with BUD (7.6) but not ML + CZ (11.5) compared with PL
      (13.6). In conclusion, both combined mediator blockade and combined topical
      corticosteroids are equally effective antiasthma therapy in patients with asthma 
      and SAR.

TI  - Spontaneous variability of cardiac output in ventilated critically ill patients.
PG  - 941-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the magnitude of spontaneous cardiac output variability over
      time in sedated medical intensive care unit patients attached to a continuous
      cardiac output monitor, and to determine whether high level positive
      end-expiratory pressure or inverse inspiratory-to-expiratory (I:E) ratio
      ventilation resulted in greater variability over time than low positive
      end-expiratory pressure with conventional I:E ratio ventilation. DESIGN:
      Prospective study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit in a tertiary medical
      center. PATIENTS: A total of 22 hemodynamically stable acute respiratory failure 
      patients with a pulmonary artery catheter inserted for hemodynamic monitoring
      INTERVENTIONS: After being sedated, patients were randomized ultimately to
      receive pressure control ventilation first at setting A (high positive
      end-expiratory pressure [15 cm H2O] with conventional I:E ratio [1:2]) and then
      at setting B (low positive end-expiratory pressure [5 cm H2O] with inverse I:E
      ratio [2:1]), or vice versa, and then at setting C (low positive end-expiratory
      pressure [5 cm H2O] with conventional I:E ratio [1:2]). Each ventilation setting 
      period lasted 1 hr. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cardiac output (CO) was
      measured continuously. The continuous CO value displayed was updated every 30-60 
      secs. The updated value reflected an average of the previous 3-6 mins. The
      coefficient of variation (CV) of CO for each setting in each patient was
      calculated to represent the spontaneous variability. The mean CO+/-SD and CV of
      each setting was 5.7+/-1.8 L/min and 4.4% for setting A, 5.6+/-1.5 L/min and 4.6%
      for setting B, and 5.9+/-1.7 L/min and 4.8% for setting C. Analysis of variance
      revealed no significant differences between the CVs of the three settings. The
      95% confidence interval for the COs for each setting was approximately the mean
      CO+/-0.1 x mean CO measured. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill sedated medical
      intensive care unit patients with stable hemodynamics, the spontaneous
      variability of cardiac output over time was not significant. High positive
      end-expiratory pressure (15 cm H2O) and inverse ratio ventilation (2:1) did not
      contribute to increased spontaneous variability of cardiac output.

TI  - Functional antagonism with formoterol and salmeterol in asthmatic patients
      expressing the homozygous glycine-16 beta(2)-adrenoceptor polymorphism.
PG  - 321-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Formoterol and salmeterol differ in their relative intrinsic activity
      at airway beta(2)-adrenoceptors, with formoterol being a full agonist. The
      homozygous glycine-16 polymorphism of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor occurs in
      approximately 40% of patients and is known to predispose to agonist-induced
      downregulation and desensitization. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate possible differences 
      in intrinsic beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist activity between salmeterol and
      formoterol in terms of their functional antagonism against methacholine-induced
      bronchoconstriction (the primary end point) in genetically susceptible patients
      who exhibited the homozygous glycine-16 polymorphism. METHODS: Eighteen patients 
      with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroid who
      expressed the homozygous glycine-16 genotype were randomized to completion (mean 
      [SEM] age, 35.8 [3.2] years; mean FEV(1), 76.9 [2. 5]% predicted). Patients
      received three different treatments for 1 week in randomized, double-blind,
      crossover fashion, with a 1-week washout period between treatments: formoterol,
      12 microg bid; salmeterol, 50 microg bid; and placebo. For each of the randomized
      treatment periods, there were three separate methacholine challenges: baseline
      after washout, 12 h after the first dose, and 12 h after the last dose. RESULTS: 
      Both salmeterol and formoterol exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) greater
      bronchoprotection than placebo for their effects after single or repeated dosing,
      although there was no significant difference between the two drugs. The geometric
      mean fold protection vs placebo (95% confidence interval [CI]) for the first dose
      was 1.6-fold (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.2) for salmeterol and 1.9-fold (95% CI, 1.1 to
      3.2) for formoterol, and for last dose was 1.6-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.3) for
      salmeterol and 1. 9-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8) for formoterol. Salmeterol and
      formoterol produced significant (p < 0.05) increases in FEV(1) and forced
      expiratory flow after 25 to 75% of vital capacity has been expelled, after the
      first but not the last dose compared to placebo, while there were significant (p 
      < 0.05) improvements in domiciliary peak flows during treatment with both drugs. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results showed no difference between formoterol and salmeterol in
      the degree of functional antagonism against methacholine-induced
      bronchoconstriction at the end of a 12-h dosing interval in patients who
      expressed the homozygous glycine-16 genotype. There was a significant residual
      degree of bronchoprotection after 1 week of treatment, which was not
      significantly different compared to the first-dose effect.

TI  - Complications of hysteroscopic surgery: predicting patients at risk.
PG  - 517-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of operative complications and whether they
      can be predicted by specific patient characteristics or type of hysteroscopic
      procedure. METHODS: We collected demographic and medical history information on
      925 women who had hysteroscopies from 1995 through 1996. We compared differences 
      in rates of operative complications of specific hysteroscopic procedures.
      Operative complications were defined as uterine perforation, excessive glycine
      absorption (1 L or more), hyponatremia, hemorrhage (500 mL or more), bowel or
      bladder injury, inability to dilate the cervix, and procedure-related hospital
      admissions. RESULTS: Operative complications occurred in 25 (2.7%) of 925
      hysteroscopies. Excessive fluid absorption was the most frequent complication.
      Hysteroscopic myomectomy and resection of uterine septum were associated with
      greater odds of complications (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      3.3, 16.6 and OR 4.0, 95% CI 0.9, 19.6, respectively). Hysteroscopic polypectomy 
      and endometrial ablation were associated with lower odds of complications (OR
      0.1, 95% CI 0.0, 0.7 and OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1, 3.3, respectively). Hysteroscopies
      done by reproductive endocrinologists and preoperative GnRH agonist therapy were 
      associated with 4-7 times higher odds for operative complications. CONCLUSION:
      Complications during hysteroscopic surgery are rare. Among hysteroscopic
      procedures, myomectomies and resections of uterine septa have significantly
      higher rates of complications, especially excessive fluid absorption. Meticulous 
      fluid management might limit the number of serious complications of these
      higher-risk procedures.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled, prophylaxis study of lamotrigine in
      rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Lamictal 614 Study Group.
PG  - 841-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder are often treatment
      refractory. This study examined lamotrigine as maintenance monotherapy for
      rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. METHOD: Lamotrigine was added to patients'
      current psychotropic regimens and titrated to clinical effect during an
      open-label treatment phase. Stabilized patients were tapered off other
      psychotropics and randomly assigned to lamotrigine or placebo monotherapy for 6
      months. Time to additional pharmacotherapy for emerging symptoms was the primary 
      outcome measure. Secondary efficacy measures included survival in study (time to 
      any premature discontinuation), percentage of patients stable without relapse for
      6 months, and changes in the Global Assessment Scale and Clinical Global
      Impressions-Severity scale. Safety was assessed from adverse event, physical
      examination, and laboratory data. RESULTS: 324 patients with rapid-cycling
      bipolar disorder (DSM-IV criteria) received open-label lamotrigine, and 182
      patients were randomly assigned to the double-blind maintenance phase. The
      difference between the treatment groups in time to additional pharmacotherapy did
      not achieve statistical significance in the overall efficacy population. However,
      survival in study was statistically different between the treatment groups (p =
      .036). Analyses also indicated a 6-week difference in median survival time
      favoring lamotrigine. Forty-one percent of lamotrigine patients versus 26% of
      placebo patients (p = .03) were stable without relapse for 6 months of
      monotherapy. Lamotrigine was well tolerated; there were no treatment-related
      changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or body weight. No serious rashes 
      occurred. CONCLUSION: This was the largest and only prospective
      placebo-controlled study of rapid-cycling bipolar disorder patients to date;
      results indicate lamotrigine monotherapy is a useful treatment for some patients 
      with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder.

TI  - Efficacy of new, concise schedule for melarsoprol in treatment of sleeping
      sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense: a randomised trial.
PG  - 1419-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: African trypanosomiasis is a fatal disease caused by protozoan
      parasites of the species Trypanosoma brucei. The disease has reached epidemic
      dimensions in various countries of central Africa. Treatment of the second stage 
      is long and complicated, and is hampered by severe adverse reactions to the
      first-line drug, melarsoprol. Despite these problems, melarsoprol is likely to
      remain the drug of choice for the next decade. We therefore did a randomised
      trial comparing the standard treatment schedule with a new, concise regimen.
      METHODS: The safety and efficacy of the new schedule were assessed in patients
      presenting to a hospital in Kwanza Norte, Angola with sleeping sickness. The
      control group followed the 26-day standard Angolan schedule of three series of
      four daily injections of melarsoprol at doses increasing from 1.2 to 3.6 mg/kg
      within each series, with a 7-day interval between series. The new treatment
      schedule comprised 10 daily injections of 2.2 mg/kg. Primary outcomes assessed
      were elimination of parasites, deaths attributed to treatment, and rate of
      encephalopathy. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Of 767 patients
      with second-stage disease, 500 were enrolled: 250 were assigned the standard
      schedule, and 250 the new schedule. 40 patients on the standard schedule and 47
      on the new schedule had adverse events which resulted in treatment disruption or 
      withdrawal. 50 patients on the standard regimen deviated or withdrew from
      treatment, compared with two on the new regimen. Parasitological cure 24 h after 
      treatment was 100% in both groups; there were six deaths (all due to
      encephalopathy) 30 days after treatment in each group. The number of patients
      with encephalopathic syndromes was also the same in each group (14). Skin
      reactions were more common with the new treatment, but all could be resolved by
      additional medication or withdrawal of treatment. INTERPRETATION: Considering the
      economic and practical advantages of the new 10-day schedule over the standard
      26-day treatment schedule, and the similarity of treatment outcome, the new
      schedule is a useful alternative to the present standard, especially in epidemic 
      situations and in locations with limited resources.

TI  - Effects of a clinical-practice guideline and practice-based education on
      detection and outcome of depression in primary care: Hampshire Depression Project
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a major individual and public-health burden throughout 
      the world and is managed mainly in primary care. The most effective strategy to
      reduce this burden has been believed to be education of primary-care
      practitioners. We tested this assumption by assessing the effectiveness of an
      educational programme based on a clinical-practice guideline in improving the
      recognition and outcome of primary-care depression. METHODS: We carried out a
      randomised controlled trial in a representative sample of 60 primary-care
      practices (26% of the total) in an English health district. Education was
      delivered to practice teams and quality tested by feedback from participants and 
      expert raters. The primary endpoints were recognition of depression, defined by
      the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale, and clinical improvement.
      Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: The education was well received by 
      participants, 80% of whom thought it would change their management of patients
      with depression. 21409 patients were screened, of whom 4192 were classified as
      depressed by the HAD scale. The sensitivity of physicians to depressive symptoms 
      was 39% in the intervention group and 36% in the control group after education
      (odds ratio 1.2 [95% CI 0.88-1.61]). The outcome of depressed patients as a whole
      at 6 weeks or 6 months after the assessment did not significantly improve.
      INTERPRETATION: Although well received, this in-practice programme, which was
      designed to convey the current consensus on best practice for the care of
      depression, did not deliver improvements in recognition of or recovery from
      depression.

TI  - A multicenter, double-blind, dose-ranging, randomized, placebo-controlled study
      of recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis: radiologic progression and correlation of Genant and Larsen
      scores.
PG  - 1001-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate radiographic progression and the relationship of
      radiologic scores obtained by the Genant and Larsen methods in a clinical trial
      of recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). METHODS:
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomized into 4 groups: placebo (n
      = 121) or IL-1Ra at a daily dosage of 30 mg (n = 119), 75 mg (n = 116), or 150 mg
      (n = 116). Hand radiographs obtained at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks were
      scored using both methods. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, by the Genant method, there was 
      significant reduction in the score for progression of joint space narrowing (JSN)
      and the total score (a combination of erosion and JSN) in all treatment groups.
      Least-squares mean changes in the Genant erosion score from baseline to 24 weeks 
      were significantly reduced after treatment with IL-1Ra at 30 mg/day and for all
      IL-1Ra treatment groups combined. The changes corresponded to a reduction of 38% 
      in erosion, 58% in JSN, and 47% in total score. Patients treated with IL-1Ra at
      75 mg/day had a significant reduction in the Larsen erosive joint count (LEJC),
      and all IL-1RA-treated groups combined showed a 45% reduction. Correlations (r)
      between the Genant total and Larsen scores were 0.84 at baseline, 0.83 at week
      24, and 0.83 at week 48 (P < 0.0001); correlations between the Genant erosion
      score and the LEJC were 0.83 (P < 0.0001) at all visits; correlations between the
      Genant total and the Larsen scores were 0.32 and 0.49 (P < 0.0001) for
      progression from baseline to week 24 and from baseline to week 48, respectively; 
      correlations between the Genant erosion score and the LEJC were 0.36 and 0.41 (P 
      < 0.0001) for progression to weeks 24 and 48, respectively. CONCLUSION: IL-1Ra
      reduced radiologic progression of RA. Scores by the 2 methods correlated strongly
      for each individual time point, but much less strongly for assessments of disease
      progression.

TI  - Regular inhaled salbutamol and asthma control: the TRUST randomised trial.
      Therapy Working Group of the National Asthma Task Force and the MRC General
      Practice Research Framework.
PG  - 1675-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous work has suggested that the long-term regular use of inhaled
      beta2-agonist bronchodilators might lead to a deterioration in asthma control.
      The aim of TRUST (The Regular Use of Salbutamol Trial) was to study the effects
      of regular use of inhaled salbutamol, the most widely prescribed bronchodilator
      in the UK, on the control of asthma. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial was undertaken in 983 patients with asthma being treated
      at least twice a week with short-acting beta2-agonist, alone or in combination
      with inhaled steroids (2 mg or less) daily. Patients were aged 18 years and over 
      and were recruited from 115 general practices in the UK. 90% (881) of the
      patients used inhaled corticosteroid therapy, and all patients continued to use
      their usual inhaled beta2-agonist for symptomatic relief. Patients were
      randomised to receive 400 microg salbutamol or matched placebo via a Diskhaler
      four times per day for 12 months. The primary outcome measure was rate of
      exacerbations of asthma, with criteria based on data from diary cards completed
      daily by each patient, treatment with additional corticosteroids, or both.
      FINDINGS: There were no differences in the annual rate, timing, or duration of
      exacerbations between the two groups. The mean morning peak expiratory flow was
      similar for the two groups. The mean evening peak expiratory flow (p<0.001) and
      the diurnal variation (p<0.001) were greater, and the use of rescue
      bronchodilator was less (p<0.001), in the group receiving regular salbutamol.
      INTERPRETATION: There was no evidence that regular use of inhaled salbutamol 400 
      microg four times daily for a year increased the exacerbation rate of asthma in
      the population studied.

TI  - Inhaled zanamivir for the prevention of influenza in families. Zanamivir Family
      Study Group.
PG  - 1282-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: As prophylaxis against influenza in families, amantadine and
      rimantadine have had inconsistent effectiveness, partly because of the
      transmission of drug-resistant variants from treated index patients. We performed
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of inhaled zanamivir for the treatment
      and prevention of influenza in families. METHODS: We enrolled families (with two 
      to five members and at least one child who was five years of age or older) before
      the 1998-1999 influenza season. If an influenza-like illness developed in one
      member, the family was randomly assigned to receive either inhaled zanamivir or
      placebo. The family member with the index illness was treated with either 10 mg
      of inhaled zanamivir (163 subjects) or placebo (158) twice a day for 5 days, and 
      the other family members received either 10 mg of zanamivir (414 subjects) or
      placebo (423) once a day as prophylaxis for 10 days. The primary end point was
      the proportion of families in which at least one household contact had
      symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza. RESULTS: The proportion of families 
      with at least one initially healthy household contact in whom influenza developed
      was smaller in the zanamivir group than in the placebo group (4 percent vs. 19
      percent, P<0.001); the difference represented a 79 percent reduction in the
      proportion of families with at least one affected contact. Zanamivir provided
      protection against both influenza A and influenza B. A neuraminidase-inhibition
      assay and sequencing of the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin genes revealed no
      zanamivir-resistant variants. Among the subjects with index cases of
      laboratory-confirmed influenza, the median duration of symptoms was 2.5 days
      shorter in the zanamivir group than in the placebo group (5.0 vs. 7.5 days,
      P=0.01). Zanamivir was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: When combined with the
      treatment of index cases, prophylactic treatment of family members with
      once-daily inhaled zanamivir is well tolerated and prevents the development of
      influenza. In this study there was no evidence of the emergence of resistant
      influenza variants.

TI  - Low-dose dopamine in patients with early renal dysfunction: a placebo-controlled 
      randomised trial. Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS)
      Clinical Trials Group.
PG  - 2139-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-dose dopamine is commonly administered to critically ill patients
      in the belief that it reduces the risk of renal failure by increasing renal blood
      flow. However, these effects have not been established in a large randomised
      controlled trial, and use of dopamine remains controversial. We have done a
      multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of low-dose
      dopamine in patients with at least two criteria for the systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome and clinical evidence of early renal dysfunction (oliguria or
      increase in serum creatinine concentration). METHODS: 328 patients admitted to 23
      participating intensive-care units (ICUs) were randomly assigned a continuous
      intravenous infusion of low-dose dopamine (2 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or placebo
      administered through a central venous catheter while in the ICU. The primary
      endpoint was the peak serum creatinine concentration during the infusion.
      Analyses excluded four patients with major protocol violations. FINDINGS: The
      groups assigned dopamine (n=161) and placebo (n=163) were similar in terms of
      baseline characteristics, renal function, and duration of trial infusion. There
      was no difference between the dopamine and placebo groups in peak serum
      creatinine concentration during treatment (245 [SD 144] vs 249 [147] micromol/L; 
      p=0.93), in the increase from baseline to highest value during treatment (62
      [107] vs 66 [108] micromol/L; p=0.82), or in the numbers of patients whose serum 
      creatinine concentration exceeded 300 micromol/L (56 vs 56; p=0.92) or who
      required renal replacement therapy (35 vs 40; p=0.55). Durations of ICU stay (13 
      [14] vs 14 [15] days; p=0.67) and of hospital stay (29 [27] vs 33 [39] days;
      p=0.29) were also similar. There were 69 deaths in the dopamine group and 66 in
      the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: Administration of low-dose dopamine by
      continuous intravenous infusion to critically ill patients at risk of renal
      failure does not confer clinically significant protection from renal dysfunction.

TI  - The impact of regular vaginal pH screening on the diagnosis of bacterial
      vaginosis in pregnancy.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis has recently been associated with preterm labor
      and delivery. The purpose of our study was to determine whether regular prenatal 
      vaginal pH testing resulted in more frequent diagnoses of bacterial vaginosis and
      other vaginal infections, more frequent treatment with antibiotics, and fewer
      preterm deliveries. We also sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity
      of pH testing and vaginal symptom reporting in identifying vaginal infections.
      METHODS: Our study was a prospective clinical trial involving 121 pregnant women 
      randomized to receive either standard prenatal care, including routine inquiry
      about vaginal symptoms, or standard care supplemented by vaginal pH testing.
      Women with symptoms or a vaginal pH level >4.5 received a wet mount examination. 
      Confirmed infections were treated according to study protocols. RESULTS: Women
      who received regular pH testing showed significantly higher detection rates for
      bacterial vaginosis than controls (48.4% vs 27.1%, P =.015) and more frequent
      detection of Trichomonas vaginalis (7.8% vs 1.7%, P = .116). A higher percentage 
      of women in the experimental group were treated for bacterial vaginosis and
      trichomoniasis (46.9% vs 27.1%, P =.024), and the preterm birth rate was one half
      that of the control group (4.7% vs 10.2%, P = .243). The presence of vaginal
      symptoms or a vaginal pH level >4.5 identified bacterial vaginosis or
      trichomoniasis with 84.4% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, frequent
      vaginal pH testing during pregnancy resulted in more frequent diagnosis and
      treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Since vaginal symptoms and elevated pH levels
      appear to be useful in screening for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis,
      frequent pH testing should be evaluated in larger studies.

TI  - The effects of transdermal estradiol on the response to mental stress in
      postmenopausal women: a randomized trial.
PG  - 463-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Estrogens inhibit adrenomedullary catecholamine release and
      catecholamine-mediated responses to stress. We examined whether estrogen
      supplementation reduces the sympathoadrenal response to mental stress in
      postmenopausal women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the effects of 3-week
      treatment with transdermal 17-beta-estradiol and placebo in 10 postmenopausal
      women using a randomized, blinded, crossover design. We measured plasma
      catecholamine levels and the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to a
      15-minute stress with mental arithmetic. Treatments were compared using repeated 
      measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: During placebo treatment, mean (+/- SD)
      epinephrine levels reached a peak of 431 +/- 135 pmol/liter after 15 minutes of
      stress; the epinephrine response was blunted during estradiol treatment, with a
      peak of 357 +/- 77 pmol/liter (P <0.05). Estradiol also blunted the diastolic
      blood pressure response to stress (baseline levels of 78 +/- 15 mm Hg vs peak of 
      90 +/- 6 mm Hg during placebo; baseline of 80 +/- 8 mm Hg vs peak of 84 +/- 6 mm 
      Hg during estradiol; P <0.05). Estradiol treatment also blunted the decrease in
      the standard deviation of the mean of the electrocardiographic RR intervals and
      the increase in the ratio between the low-frequency and high-frequency
      bandwidths. CONCLUSION: We observed a moderate, although significant, reduction
      in markers of the stress response to mental arithmetic in postmenopausal women
      treated with transdermal 17-beta-estradiol.

TI  - Raloxifene and estrogen effects on quality of life in healthy postmenopausal
      women: a placebo-controlled randomized trial.
PG  - 359-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of raloxifene, estrogen, and placebo on quality 
      of life in healthy, asymptomatic, postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a
      multicenter, double-blind, 12-month study, 398 women were assigned randomly to
      one of four groups: raloxifene HCl, 60 (n = 97) or 150 mg/day (n = 100);
      conjugated equine estrogens, 0. 625 mg/day (n = 96); or placebo (n = 105). The
      Women's Health Questionnaire, a validated quality-of-life instrument for
      perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, was administered at baseline and 3-month
      intervals. RESULTS: Overall, quality of life from baseline to end point was
      preserved equally in all treatment groups. Six domains (depressed mood, somatic
      symptoms, memory/concentration, sexual behavior, sleep problems, and perceived
      attractiveness) were unchanged in all groups. Three domains (menstrual symptoms, 
      vasomotor symptoms, and anxiety/fears) were statistically significantly different
      among groups. Mean scores for menstrual symptoms significantly worsened and
      vasomotor symptoms significantly improved from baseline to end point in the
      estrogen group. Mean scores for vasomotor symptoms did not worsen at any point in
      the raloxifene 60 mg/day group. Mean anxiety/fears scores improved significantly 
      during raloxifene 60 mg/day administration throughout treatment (P <.05),
      irrespective of previous hormone replacement therapy, baseline estradiol (E2)
      levels, or years postmenopause. CONCLUSION: Most quality-of-life domains were not
      affected by treatment with estrogen or raloxifene. Estrogen provided relief from 
      vasomotor symptoms but caused menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene 60 mg/day improved
      anxiety levels in postmenopausal women.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the postoperative
      dilation of two types of knitted polyester arterial prostheses with the use of
      helical computed tomographic scanning. METHODS: Thirty-four patients who
      underwent aortoiliac or aortofemoral bifurcation grafting were randomized to
      receive a collagen-sealed warp-knitted polyester graft (n = 16 patients) or a
      gelatin-sealed Koper-knitted polyester graft (n = 18 patients). Alterations in
      size of all parts of the grafts were evaluated by helical computed tomographic
      scanning at postoperative day 8, at 3 months, and at 6 months. RESULTS: On
      postoperative day 8, the mean dilation of the Koper-knitted grafts was 18% +/- 8%
      for the stem and 15% +/- 12% for the limbs. At the same time period, the mean
      dilation of warp-knitted grafts was 27% +/- 13% for the stem and 33% +/- 18% for 
      the limbs. No increase in graft dilation was observed at 3 and 6 months. Despite 
      the wide range of values among patients with the same graft type, at each time
      interval, the Koper-knitted grafts dilated significantly less than the
      warp-knitted grafts (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: In this randomized study, helical
      computed tomographic scanning was an accurate technique with which to assess
      graft dilation. For a 6-month follow-up interval, the Koper-knitted polyester
      structure dilated less than the warp-knitted structure. Longer-term serial scans 
      should allow a better understanding of the clinical significance of graft
      dilation.

TI  - Randomized comparison of antiarrhythmic drug therapy with implantable
      defibrillators in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest : the Cardiac Arrest 
      Study Hamburg (CASH).
PG  - 748-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized comparison of
      implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy
      in survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to documented ventricular arrhythmias.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1987, eligible patients were randomized to an ICD,
      amiodarone, propafenone, or metoprolol (ICD versus antiarrhythmic agents
      randomization ratio 1:3). Assignment to propafenone was discontinued in March
      1992, after an interim analysis conducted in 58 patients showed a 61% higher
      all-cause mortality rate than in 61 ICD patients during a follow-up of 11.3
      months. The study continued to recruit 288 patients in the remaining 3 study
      groups; of these, 99 were assigned to ICDs, 92 to amiodarone, and 97 to
      metoprolol. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The study was
      terminated in March 1998, when all patients had concluded a minimum 2-year
      follow-up. Over a mean follow-up of 57+/-34 months, the crude death rates were
      36.4% (95% CI 26.9% to 46.6%) in the ICD and 44.4% (95% CI 37.2% to 51.8%) in the
      amiodarone/metoprolol arm. Overall survival was higher, though not significantly,
      in patients assigned to ICD than in those assigned to drug therapy (1-sided
      P=0.081, hazard ratio 0.766, [97.5% CI upper bound 1.112]). In ICD patients, the 
      percent reductions in all-cause mortality were 41.9%, 39.3%, 28. 4%, 27.7%,
      22.8%, 11.4%, 9.1%, 10.6%, and 24.7% at years 1 to 9 of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS:
      During long-term follow-up of cardiac arrest survivors, therapy with an ICD is
      associated with a 23% (nonsignificant) reduction of all-cause mortality rates
      when compared with treatment with amiodarone/metoprolol. The benefit of ICD
      therapy is more evident during the first 5 years after the index event.

TI  - Cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia secondary to chronic pain.
PG  - 407-16
AB  - Sixty participants with insomnia secondary to chronic pain were assigned randomly
      to either a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or a self-monitoring/waiting-list 
      control condition. The therapy consisted of a multicomponent 7-week group
      intervention aimed at promoting good sleep habits, teaching relaxation skills,
      and changing negative thoughts about sleep. Treated participants were
      significantly more improved than control participants on self-report measures of 
      sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and sleep
      quality, and they showed less motor activity in ambulatory recordings of
      nocturnal movement. At a 3-month follow-up assessment, treated participants
      showed good maintenance of most therapeutic gains. These results provide the 1st 
      evidence from a randomized controlled trial that CBT is an effective treatment
      for insomnia that is secondary to chronically painful medical conditions.

TI  - Randomised trial of fluid restriction in ventilated very low birthweight infants.
PG  - F91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluid restriction has been reported to improve survival of infants
      without chronic lung disease (CLD), but it remains unknown whether it reduces CLD
      in a population at high risk of CLD routinely exposed to antenatal steroids and
      postnatal surfactant without increasing other adverse outcomes. AIM: To
      investigate the impact of fluid restriction on the outcome of ventilated, very
      low birthweight infants. STUDY DESIGN: A randomised trial of two fluid input
      levels in the perinatal period was performed. A total of 168 ventilated infants
      (median gestational age 27 weeks (range 23-33)) were randomly assigned to receive
      standard volumes of fluid (60 ml/kg on day 1 progressing to 150 ml/kg on day 7)
      or be restricted to about 80% of standard input. RESULTS: Similar proportions of 
      infants on the two regimens had CLD beyond 28 days (56% v 51%) and 36 weeks post 
      conceptional age (26% v 25%), survived without oxygen dependency at 28 days (31% 
      v 27%) and 36 weeks post conceptional age (58% v 52%), and developed acute renal 
      failure. There were no statistically significant differences between other
      outcomes, except that fewer of the restricted group (19% v 43%) required
      postnatal steroids (p < 0.01). In the trial population overall, duration of
      oxygen dependency related significantly to the colloid (p < 0.01), but not
      crystalloid, input level; after adjustment for specified covariates, the hazard
      ratio was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.13). CONCLUSIONS: In
      ventilated, very low birthweight infants, fluid restriction in the perinatal
      period neither reduces CLD nor increases other adverse outcomes. Colloid
      infusion, however, is associated with increased duration of oxygen dependency.

TI  - Is melatonin treatment effective for tardive dyskinesia?
PG  - 556-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia is a severe and disabling side effect of
      conventional antipsychotic treatment, with incidence rates reaching a high of 50%
      in chronically institutionalized populations. On the basis of recent studies
      showing some benefit of antioxidants, we evaluated the effect of melatonin, the
      most potent naturally occurring antioxidant, on tardive dyskinesia in patients
      with chronic schizophrenia. METHOD: Nineteen patients (8 men, 11 women), aged a
      mean +/- SD 74.0+/-9.5 years with chronic DSM-IV schizophrenia of 31.3+/-7.0
      years' duration, were randomly assigned in a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover trial to receive slow-release melatonin, 2 mg/day, or placebo for 4
      weeks. After a 2-week washout period, the patients were switched to the other
      treatment arm for an additional 4 weeks. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
      (AIMS) was administered at baseline, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 10 weeks. Regular
      administration of antipsychotic and other medications was kept unchanged
      throughout the study. RESULTS: Mean AIMS scores did not change significantly from
      baseline in either treatment arm. All patients completed the study, and there
      were no side effects or adverse events. CONCLUSION: Supraphysiologic doses of
      melatonin do not positively affect tardive dyskinesia. Considering that melatonin
      is a safe drug, further studies are needed of higher doses and in patients with
      shorter disease duration before its use in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia is
      ruled out.

TI  - Salmeterol administration by metered-dose inhaler alone vs metered-dose inhaler
      plus valved holding chamber.
PG  - 1314-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a spacer device designed as a valved
      holding chamber with a flow signal increases the efficacy of the long-acting
      beta(2)-agonist, salmeterol, in patients who use incorrect technique with
      metered-dose inhaler (MDI) alone. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled study. SETTING: University hospital outpatient rooms.
      PATIENTS: Twenty adult outpatients with stable persistent asthma, receiving a
      daily anti-inflammatory drug. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to either
      salmeterol MDI (incorrect use: 1 s after actuating MDI, inhale rapidly) and
      placebo plus spacer (correct use: inhale slowly as MDI is actuated, continue to
      inhale slowly and deeply) or placebo MDI (incorrect use) and salmeterol plus
      spacer (correct use). The following week, patients received the opposite
      treatment. The dose was two puffs from each device on each treatment day; each
      puff was separated by 1 min. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: After baseline peak
      expiratory flow (PEF), salmeterol was administered and serial PEF determined
      (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h). Administration of salmeterol MDI plus
      spacer resulted in significantly greater increases in PEF from baseline vs MDI at
      4 h (44 L/min vs 10 L/min; p < 0.01) and 6 h (49 L/min vs 24 L/min; p < 0.05).
      Both methods of administration were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: We
      conclude that patients who have poor timing and rapid inhalation with salmeterol 
      MDI alone will have greater increases in PEF at 4 h and 6 h and no additional
      side effects if the dose is administered with a valved holding chamber that is
      used correctly. Further study is needed regarding other errors in MDI technique
      with salmeterol.

TI  - The treatment of social phobia in general practice. is exposure therapy feasible?
PG  - 114-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure therapy is an effective treatment for generalized social
      phobia. Most patients with social phobia are treated in primary care, but family 
      doctors are not usually trained to perform exposure therapy. We have conducted a 
      study in primary care of the effect of exposure therapy alone or in combination
      with sertraline on generalized social phobia. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this
      article is to describe the training of GPs and the application of the treatment
      programme in general practice. METHOD: Forty-five GPs were trained for
      approximately 30 h in assessing patients with social phobia and conducting
      exposure therapy. The training programme included scoring of videotaped
      interviews of five patients on several social phobia scales, and a videotape
      demonstrating different steps of an exposure therapy was used as a model for role
      play in group training. RESULTS: All of the GPs completed the training programme.
      The doctors expressed satisfaction with the programme and also found it useful in
      the treatment of patients with conditions other than social phobia. There was a
      significant difference in response between the treatment groups (P = 0.001), and 
      the combination of exposure therapy and sertraline seemed to be particularly
      beneficial.

TI  - Beneficial effects of high dietary fiber intake in patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus.
PG  - 1392-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of increasing the intake of dietary fiber on glycemic
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is controversial. METHODS: In a
      randomized, crossover study, we assigned 13 patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus to follow two diets, each for six weeks: a diet containing moderate
      amounts of fiber (total, 24 g; 8 g of soluble fiber and 16 g of insoluble fiber),
      as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and a high-fiber diet 
      (total, 50 g; 25 g of soluble fiber and 25 g of insoluble fiber), containing
      foods not fortified with fiber (unfortified foods). Both diets, prepared in a
      research kitchen, had the same macronutrient and energy content. We compared the 
      effects of the two diets on glycemic control and plasma lipid concentrations.
      RESULTS: Compliance with the diets was excellent. During the sixth week, the
      high-fiber diet, as compared with the the sixth week of the ADA diet, mean daily 
      preprandial plasma glucose concentrations were 13 mg per deciliter [0.7 mmol per 
      liter] lower (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 24 mg per deciliter [0.1 to
      1.3 mmol per liter]; P=0.04) and mean median difference, daily urinary glucose
      excretion 1.3 g (0.23; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 1.83 g; P= 0.008).
      The high-fiber diet also lowered the area under the curve for 24-hour plasma
      glucose and insulin concentrations, which were measured every two hours, by 10
      percent (P=0.02) and 12 percent (P=0.05), respectively. The high-fiber diet
      reduced plasma total cholesterol concentrations by 6.7 percent (P=0.02),
      triglyceride concentrations by 10.2 percent (P=0.02), and very-low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations by 12.5 percent (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A
      high intake of dietary fiber, particularly of the soluble type, above the level
      recommended by the ADA, improves glycemic control, decreases hyperinsulinemia,
      and lowers plasma lipid concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Skin-to-skin contact is analgesic in healthy newborns.
PG  - e14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their
      newborns will reduce the pain experienced by the infant during heel lance.
      DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Boston Medical
      Center, Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 newborn infants were
      studied. INTERVENTIONS: Infants were assigned randomly to either being held by
      their mothers in whole body, skin-to-skin contact or to no intervention (swaddled
      in crib) during a standard heel lance procedure. OUTCOME MEASURES: The
      effectiveness of the intervention was determined by comparing crying, grimacing, 
      and heart rate differences between contact and control infants during and after
      blood collection. RESULTS: Crying and grimacing were reduced by 82% and 65%,
      respectively, from control infant levels during the heel lance procedure. Heart
      rate also was reduced substantially by contact. CONCLUSION: Skin-to-skin contact 
      is a remarkably potent intervention against the pain experienced during heel
      stick in newborns.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone addition in serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 794-801
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, only 1 controlled study has found a drug (haloperidol) to be
      efficacious in augmenting response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD) refractory to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) monotherapy; patients with
      comorbid chronic tic disorders showed a preferential response. This report
      describes the first controlled study of risperidone addition in patients with OCD
      refractory to treatment with SRI alone. METHODS: Seventy adult patients with a
      primary DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD received 12 weeks of treatment with an SRI.
      Thirty-six patients were refractory to the SRI and were randomized in a
      double-blind manner to 6 weeks of risperidone (n = 20) or placebo (n = 16)
      addition. Behavioral ratings, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
      Scale, were obtained at baseline and throughout the trial. Placebo-treated
      patients subsequently received an identical open-label trial of risperidone
      addition. RESULTS: For study completers, 9 (50%) of 18 risperidone-treated
      patients were responders (mean daily dose, 2.2 +/-0.7 mg/d) compared with 0 of 15
      in the placebo addition group (P<. 005). Seven (50%) of 14 patients who received 
      open-label risperidone addition responded. Risperidone addition was superior to
      placebo in reducing OCD (P<.001), depressive (P<.001), and anxiety (P =.003)
      symptoms. There was no difference in response between OCD patients with and
      without comorbid diagnoses of chronic tic disorder or schizotypal personalty
      disorder. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OCD patients with and without comorbid
      chronic tic disorders or schizotypal personality disorder may respond to the
      addition of low-dose risperidone to ongoing SRI therapy.

TI  - The effect of inhaled budesonide on symptoms, lung function, and cold air and
      methacholine responsiveness in 2- to 5-year-old asthmatic children.
PG  - 1500-6
AB  - We hypothesized that measurement of lung function (LF) and bronchial
      hyperresponsiveness (BHR) could serve as supplemental tools in evaluating the
      efficacy of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic children aged 2
      to 5 yr. We studied 38 children (mean age: 53 mo; range: 35 to 71 mo) with
      moderately severe asthma in a single-center, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled study involving 8 wk of treatment. Budesonide 
      (BUD) 400 microgram twice daily was administered via a pressurized metered-dose
      inhaler and metal spacer device. Symptom scores (SSc) and use of short-acting
      beta(2)-agonist were monitored with diary cards. LF in awake children was
      measured as the specific airway resistance (sRaw), using whole-body
      plethysmography; as resistance by the interrupter technique (Rint); and as
      resistance and reactance at 5 Hz (Rrs5, Xrs5) by the impulse oscillation
      technique. Cold air challenge (CACh) and methacholine challenge (MCh) were used
      to assess BHR. Children in the BUD group experienced significantly fewer night-
      and daytime symptoms (p < 0.05) and more symptom-free days (p < 0.05), but not
      nights (p = 0.07), than children in the placebo group. Daytime (p < 0.05) but not
      nighttime (p = 0.09) use of rescue medication and asthma exacerbation rates (3.7 
      versus 9.3 exacerbations/yr) (p = 0.006) were both in favor of BUD. LF measured
      with the Rint technique, Rrs5, and Xrs5 were significantly improved by BUD. BHR
      as measured by CACh improved significantly with BUD, whereas no improvement was
      found on MCh. In conclusion, inhaled BUD at a total dose of 800 microgram daily
      significantly improved SSc, asthma exacerbation rates, lung function, and BHR as 
      assessed by CACh in asthmatic children aged 2 to 5 yr.

      cancer patients after curative surgery.
PG  - 777-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of early exercise therapy on the natural killer
      cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA) of patients who had undergone curative resection
      of stomach cancer. DESIGN: Prospective study. PATIENTS: Thirty-five stomach
      cancer patients who had undergone curative surgery were randomly divided into an 
      exercise group (n = 17) and a control group (n = 18). INTERVENTION: From
      postoperative day 2, moderated exercise using arm and bicycle ergometers
      performed twice a day, 5 times a week, for 14 days. The intensity of exercise was
      60% of maximal heart rate. Venous blood samples were obtained on postoperative
      days 1, 7, and 14. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean sequential change of NKCA. RESULTS:
      The mean sequential change of NKCA decreased until postoperative day 7 and then
      increased. Mean NKCA of day 7 decreased in both groups, compared with that at
      postoperative day 1. At day 14, the mean NKCA of the exercise group demonstrated 
      a significant increase compared with that of the control group (p < .05).
      CONCLUSION: This study suggests that early moderate exercise has a beneficial
      effect on the function of in vitro NK cells in stomach cancer patients after
      curative surgery.

TI  - Effects of a clinical-practice guideline and practice-based education on
      detection and outcome of depression in primary care: Hampshire Depression Project
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a major individual and public-health burden throughout 
      the world and is managed mainly in primary care. The most effective strategy to
      reduce this burden has been believed to be education of primary-care
      practitioners. We tested this assumption by assessing the effectiveness of an
      educational programme based on a clinical-practice guideline in improving the
      recognition and outcome of primary-care depression. METHODS: We carried out a
      randomised controlled trial in a representative sample of 60 primary-care
      practices (26% of the total) in an English health district. Education was
      delivered to practice teams and quality tested by feedback from participants and 
      expert raters. The primary endpoints were recognition of depression, defined by
      the hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scale, and clinical improvement.
      Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: The education was well received by 
      participants, 80% of whom thought it would change their management of patients
      with depression. 21409 patients were screened, of whom 4192 were classified as
      depressed by the HAD scale. The sensitivity of physicians to depressive symptoms 
      was 39% in the intervention group and 36% in the control group after education
      (odds ratio 1.2 [95% CI 0.88-1.61]). The outcome of depressed patients as a whole
      at 6 weeks or 6 months after the assessment did not significantly improve.
      INTERPRETATION: Although well received, this in-practice programme, which was
      designed to convey the current consensus on best practice for the care of
      depression, did not deliver improvements in recognition of or recovery from
      depression.

TI  - Targeted early rescue surfactant in ventilated preterm infants using the click
      test.
PG  - E30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether use of the click test, a rapid bedside test of
      surfactant function, results in earlier and more appropriate surfactant
      administration in ventilated preterm infants than does usual early rescue
      treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Ventilated preterm infants (n = 126) with inspired
      oxygen >/=25% and mean airway pressure >/=7 cm H(2)O were randomized in
      gestational strata (<28 weeks and 28-36 weeks) to have surfactant therapy
      determined by the click test or by usual clinical and chest radiograph criteria. 
      The treatment group had the click test performed on a tracheal aspirate as soon
      as possible after intubation and, if negative or equivocal (surfactant
      deficient), surfactant was given. The control group had surfactant given as soon 
      as possible based on clinical and chest radiograph diagnoses of respiratory
      distress syndrome. RESULTS: In infants of <28 weeks' gestation, use of the click 
      test resulted in significantly earlier surfactant therapy (median time: 50 vs 159
      minutes) and a reduction in the number of infants receiving surfactant (48% vs
      79%). In infants of 28 to 36 weeks' gestation, there was no difference in time to
      surfactant (median time: 300 vs 268 minutes) or in the number of infants
      receiving surfactant. Neonatal morbidity and mortality were similar in click test
      and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the click test in ventilated, extremely
      premature infants results in significantly earlier and more appropriately
      targeted administration of surfactant than does early rescue therapy based on
      clinical and radiograph criteria. A randomized trial of targeted early rescue
      surfactant therapy versus prophylactic surfactant therapy in infants of <28
      weeks' gestation is warranted. The click test has the potential to improve
      clinical outcomes and reduce costs.

TI  - A randomized, controlled trial comparing insulin lispro with human soluble
      insulin in patients with Type 1 diabetes on intensified insulin therapy. The UK
      Trial Group.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - AIMS: Despite considerable experience with insulin lispro, few blinded
      comparisons with soluble insulin are available. This study compared insulin
      lispro with human soluble insulin in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus on
      multiple injection therapy who inject shortly before meals. METHODS: Glucose
      control, frequency of hypoglycaemia and patient preference were examined in the
      course of a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover comparison, with a
      6-week run-in period and 12 weeks on each therapy. Ninety-three patients took
      part, all on multiple daily doses of insulin, with soluble insulin before meals
      and NPH (isophane) insulin at night. The main outcome measures were
      self-monitored blood glucose profiles, glycated haemoglobin, frequency of
      hypoglycaemic episodes, patient satisfaction and well-being and patient
      preference. RESULTS: Blood glucose levels were significantly lower after
      breakfast and lunch, but higher before breakfast, lunch and supper, in patients
      taking insulin lispro. Levels of HbA(1c) were 7.4 +/- 1.1% on Humulin S and 7.5
      +/- 1.1% on insulin lispro (P = 0.807). The overall frequency of symptomatic
      hypoglycaemia did not differ, but patients on insulin lispro were less likely to 
      experience hypoglycaemia between midnight and 6 a.m., and more likely to
      experience episodes from 6 a.m. to midday. Questionnaires completed by 84/87
      patients at the end of the study showed that 43 (51%) were able to identify each 
      insulin correctly, nine (11%) were incorrect, and 32 (38%) were unable to tell
      the insulins apart. No significant preference emerged: 35 (42%) opted for insulin
      lispro, 24 (29%) opted for Humulin S, while the remainder had no clear
      preference. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of insulin lispro for soluble insulin in a 
      multiple injection regimen improved post-prandial glucose control at the expense 
      of an increase in fasting and pre-prandial glucose levels. Patients who already
      injected shortly before meals expressed no clear preference for the fast-acting
      analogue, and did not improve their overall control as a result of using it.
      Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was however, less frequent on insulin lispro, and may
      emerge as a robust indication for its use.

TI  - Radiological and clinical results of longterm treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
      with methotrexate and azathioprine.
PG  - 1148-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether the reported superior effect of methotrexate (MTX)
      compared to azathioprine (AZA) in retarding radiologic progression after one year
      in rheumatoid arthritis was sustained at 2 and 4 years. METHODS: All 64 patients 
      enrolled in the original randomized double blind study were invited for an open
      extension of followup to 4 years including 4-monthly clinical and laboratory
      assessments and radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet at 2 and 4 years. RESULTS:
      After 4 years, 18 patients (58%) from the MTX group and 7 patients (21%) from the
      AZA group continued the initial study drug. During followup more patients (n =
      21) switched from AZA to MTX than vice versa (n = 5). In an intention-to-treat
      analysis improvement of clinical and laboratory variables at 4 years was more
      pronounced in the MTX group. Mean radiologic scores increased in both treatment
      groups during followup. According to an intention-to-treat analysis increase in
      erosion score at one and 2 years in the MTX group was significantly lower than in
      the AZA group: after one year MTX group 1.8 versus AZA group 5.3 (p = 0.002);
      after 2 years MTX 3.5 versus AZA 6.5 (p = 0.05). After 4 years there was a trend 
      toward less progression in the MTX group: MTX 6.8 versus AZA 10.8 (p = 0.09). For
      the total score, progression in the MTX group was less after one and 2 years.
      After 4 years marked radiologic progression was observed more often in the AZA
      group. CONCLUSION: Drug continuation after 4 years of followup was better for MTX
      than for AZA. In an intention-to-treat analysis the beneficial effect of MTX on
      radiologic progression compared with AZA was sustained after 2 years of followup.
      Thereafter differences between treatment groups leveled off, probably mainly due 
      to the greater number of switches from AZA to MTX than vice versa.

TI  - Treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy with oral vitamin K: a randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1551-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Warfarin-associated coagulopathy is a frequent clinical complication.
      We aimed to assess whether treatment with vitamin K is safe and more effective
      than placebo in rapidly lowering the international normalised ratio (INR) into
      the therapeutic range in over anticoagulated patients receiving warfarin.
      METHODS: We did a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial
      in five tertiary care hospitals. In this study, patients receiving warfarin who
      had an INR value between 4.5 and 10.0, and who did not have an indication for the
      immediate normalisation of their INR, had their warfarin withheld, and were
      randomly allocated to receive either 1 mg of vitamin K or placebo orally. The
      primary outcome measure was the INR value on the day after treatment. Secondary
      outcome measures included INR values on subsequent days, and the risk of
      haemorrhage and recurrent thrombosis over a 3 month follow-up period. FINDINGS:
      Patients given vitamin K had a more rapid decrease in the INR than those given
      placebo (25 of 45 (56%] vs nine of 44 [20%] patients with INR values of 1.8-3.2
      on the day after treatment, respectively, p=0.001; odds ratio [OR] 0.21, 95% CI
      0.07-0.57). Fewer patients given vitamin K had bleeding episodes during the
      follow-up period than those given placebo (two [4%] vs eight [17%] patients,
      respectively, p=0.050; OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.019-0.999). INTERPRETATION: Low dose
      oral vitamin K is more effective than placebo for the rapid lowering of raised
      INR values in patients taking warfarin.

TI  - Hemodynamic comparison of twice daily metoprolol tartrate with once daily
      metoprolol succinate in congestive heart failure.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the hemodynamic effects of twice daily metoprolol tartrate
      (MT) and once daily metoprolol succinate (MS) in congestive heart failure
      patients. BACKGROUND: Adverse hemodynamic effects with MT demonstrated during
      initiation persist with drug readministration during chronic therapy. METHODS:
      Patients were randomly assigned to 6.25 mg MT or 25 mg MS orally and the dose was
      gradually increased to a target of 50 mg twice a day or 100 mg once a day,
      respectively. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline and after three 
      months of therapy--both before and after drug readministration. RESULTS: Long
      term metoprolol therapy produced significant functional, exercise and hemodynamic
      benefits with no difference in response between either metoprolol preparation in 
      the 27 patients (MT [14], MS [13]). When full dose metoprolol was readministered 
      during chronic therapy, there were parallel adverse hemodynamic effects in both
      drug groups. Cardiac index decreased by 0.6 liters/min/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MT
      and by 0.5 liters/min/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MS. Systematic vascular resistance
      increased by 253 dyne-sec-cm(-5) (p < 0.001) with MT and by 267 dyne-sec-cm(-5)
      (p < 0.0005) with MS. Stroke volume index decreased by 7.0 ml/m2 (p < 0.0005)
      with MT and by 6.5 ml/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MS, while SWI decreased by 6.2 g-m/m2 
      (p < 0.0005) with MT and by 6.0 g-m/m2 (p < 0.001) with MS. CONCLUSION:
      Metoprolol tartrate and MS produce similar hemodynamic and clinical effects
      acutely and chronically despite the fourfold greater starting dose of MS used in 
      this study. A more rapid initiation with readily available starting doses of MS
      may offer distinct advantages compared with MT in treating chronic heart failure 
      patients with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.

TI  - The role of bladder catheterization in total knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 80-4
AB  - The use of a urinary bladder catheter in the perioperative period for patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty is controversial. In the current study, two
      bladder management protocols were studied. One group of patients had an
      indwelling catheter inserted into the bladder before total knee arthroplasty. The
      other group of patients was observed and treated for urinary retention as
      necessary. From 1993 to 1998, 652 patients undergoing primary, unilateral total
      knee arthroplasty were randomized by surgeon into two groups: one group underwent
      preoperative insertion of an indwelling bladder catheter (306 patients), and one 
      group (346 patients) had a catheter inserted postoperatively as necessary.
      Sixty-six percent (229 of 346) of these patients required catheterization (203
      had indwelling catheters and 26 had intermittent straight catheters). A urinary
      tract infection developed in five patients (1.6%) in whom a catheter was inserted
      preoperatively. A urinary tract infection developed in six patients (1.7%) in
      whom a catheter was inserted if necessary. Five of these urinary tract infections
      developed in patients with delayed indwelling bladder catheters. A urinary tract 
      infection did not develop in any patient in whom a straight catheter was
      inserted. There was no significant difference in the length of stay in the
      hospital between the two groups. The group in whom a catheter always was inserted
      generated $491 greater cost for total knee arthroplasty than patients in whom a
      catheter was inserted if necessary.

PG  - 1732-4
AB  - High-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) was used to
      investigate the relationship of sleep disorders with motor handicap in PD. In 10 
      insomniac patients with PD, stimulation reduced nighttime akinesia by 60% and
      completely suppressed axial and early morning dystonia, but did not alleviate
      periodic leg movements (n = 3) or REM sleep behavior disorders (n = 5). Total
      sleep time increased by 47%; wakefulness after sleep onset decreased by 51
      minutes. Insomnia in patients with PD may predominantly result from nighttime
      motor disability.

TI  - Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor after intensive consolidation chemotherapy 
      in acute myeloid leukemia: results of a randomized trial of the Groupe Ouest-Est 
      Leucemies Aigues Myeloblastiques.
PG  - 780-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Ten years after the first clinical studies, the clinical impact of
      myeloid growth factors in acute myeloid leukemia is still unclear. One of the
      objectives of the Groupe Ouest-Est Leucemies Aigues Myeloblastiques (GOELAM) 2
      trial was to evaluate the benefit of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)
      given only after the two courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy (ICC)
      used to maintain complete remission (CR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred
      ninety-four patients who were in CR after induction treatment were randomly
      assigned to receive G-CSF (100 patients) or no G-CSF (94 patients) after two
      courses of ICC (ICC 1, high-dose cytarabine plus mitoxantrone; ICC 2, amsacrine
      plus etoposide). G-CSF (filgrastim) was administered from the day after
      chemotherapy until granulocyte recovery at a daily dose of 5 microg/kg. RESULTS: 
      In the G-CSF group, the median duration of neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/L) was
      dramatically reduced, both after ICC 1 (12 v 19 days, P <.001) and after ICC 2
      (20 v 28 days, P <.001). The median duration of hospitalization was also
      significantly shorter in the G-CSF group (24 v 27 days after ICC 1, P <.001; 29 v
      34 days after ICC 2, P <. 001). The median duration of intravenous antibiotics
      was significantly reduced after ICC 1 and ICC 2, and the median duration of
      antifungal therapy was significantly reduced after ICC 1. However, the incidence 
      of microbiologically documented infections, the toxic death rate, the 2-year
      disease-free survival, and the 2-year overall survival were not affected by G-CSF
      administration. Moreover, the median interval between ICC1 and ICC2 was reduced
      by only 2 days, and the number of patients undergoing ICC2 was not increased in
      the G-CSF arm. CONCLUSION: G-CSF should be administered routinely after ICC to
      reduce the duration of neutropenia and hospitalization. However, G-CSF did not
      seem to significantly increase the feasibility of this two-course program or
      modify overall outcome.

TI  - Randomized trial of intermittent or continuous amnioinfusion for variable
      decelerations.
PG  - 571-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether continuous or intermittent bolus amnioinfusion is
      more effective in relieving variable decelerations. METHODS: Patients with
      repetitive variable decelerations were randomized to an intermittent bolus or
      continuous amnioinfusion. The intermittent bolus infusion group received boluses 
      of 500 mL of normal saline, each over 30 minutes, with boluses repeated if
      variable decelerations recurred. The continuous infusion group received a bolus
      infusion of 500 mL of normal saline over 30 minutes and then 3 mL per minute
      until delivery occurred. The ability of the amnioinfusion to abolish variable
      decelerations was analyzed, as were maternal demographic and pregnancy outcome
      variables. Power analysis indicated that 64 patients would be required. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-five patients were randomized to intermittent infusion and 30 to
      continuous infusion. There were no differences between groups in terms of
      maternal demographics, gestational age, delivery mode, neonatal outcome, median
      time to resolution of variable decelerations, or the number of times variable
      decelerations recurred. The median volume infused in the intermittent infusion
      group (500 mL) was significantly less than that in the continuous infusion group 
      (905 mL, P =.003). CONCLUSION: Intermittent bolus amnioinfusion is as effective
      as continuous infusion in relieving variable decelerations in labor. Further
      investigation is necessary to determine whether either of these techniques is
      associated with increased occurrence of rare complications such as cord prolapse 
      or uterine rupture.

TI  - Venous endothelial function in postmenopausal women who are receiving long-term
      estrogen and progestagen therapy.
PG  - 268-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test venous endothelial function during long-term hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) and after treatment withdrawal. DESIGN: Measurement of 
      dorsal hand-vein diameter by venous occlusion plethysmography during infusion of 
      norepinephrine, bradykinin, NG-monomethyl L-arginine, and sodium nitroprusside.
      SETTING: Plethysmography and menopause units, University Hospital Marques de
      Valdecilla, Santander, Spain. PATIENT(S): Twenty postmenopausal women, of whom 10
      were assigned to receive no hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for 6 months after 
      plethysmography (group A) and 10 were assigned to receive HRT for 6 months (group
      B). After 6 months, HRT was administered to group A and withdrawn from group B
      for another 6 months. INTERVENTION(S): Plethysmography at baseline and at 6 and
      12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Dorsal hand-vein diameter measured by venous 
      occlusion plethysmography during infusion of norepinephrine, bradykinin,
      NG-monomethyl L-arginine, or sodium nitroprusside. RESULT(S): At 6 months, the
      maximum dilation obtained with bradykinin was 48.8 +/- 7.58% in group A and 76.7 
      +/- 12.9% in group B. At 12 months, maximum bradykinin dilation increased to 74.3
      +/- 14.2% in group A and decreased to 54.0 +/- 15.9% in group B. CONCLUSION(S):
      Long-term HRT with estrogen plus progestin improves endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation, but this effect is lost in a relatively short time. Endothelial
      function in dorsal hand veins is an easy-to-use plethysmography model that can be
      used in serial studies.

TI  - The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and success in nutrient delivery
      with gastric versus small intestinal feeding: a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 1742-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteral feeding provides nutrients for patients who require
      endotracheal tubes and mechanical ventilation. There is a presumed increase in
      the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with tube feeding. This has
      stimulated the development of procedures for duodenal intubation and small
      intestinal (SI) feeding as primary prophylaxes to prevent VAP. OBJECTIVE: To
      investigate the rate of VAP and adequacy of nutrient delivery with gastric (G)
      vs. SI feeding. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: A
      medical intensive care unit of a county hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 44
      endotracheally intubated, mechanically ventilated patients requiring enteral
      nutrition. INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomized to receive enteral nutrition
      via G or SI feeding. Protocols directed the placement of the feeding tube and the
      infusion of enteral nutrition and defined the radiographic and clinical criteria 
      for a diagnosis of VAP. MEASUREMENTS AND OUTCOMES: The incidence of VAP and the
      adequacy of nutritional supplementation were prospectively followed. The relative
      risk of VAP with SI was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.96-2.44) compared with G. 
      The SI group received a greater percentage of their caloric requirements (SI 69
      +/- 7% vs. G 47 +/- 7%, mean +/- SEM, p < .05). Mortality did not differ between 
      G (26 +/- 9%) and SI (24 +/- 10, p = .86). CONCLUSIONS: There is no clear
      difference in the incidence of VAP in SI compared with G enteral nutrition.
      Patients given feeding into the SI do receive higher calorie and protein intakes.

TI  - Comparison of wet combing with malathion for treatment of head lice in the UK: a 
      pragmatic randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concern about the effectiveness and toxicity of insecticide lotions
      has led to promotion of mechanical methods to remove head lice. We compared the
      effectiveness of "bug-busting" (wet combing with a fine-toothed comb) and
      malathion lotion. METHODS: We screened 4037 schoolchildren in two counties in
      Wales, UK (intermediate resistance to malathion). Of 167 found to have head lice,
      81 (aged 3-14 years) were eligible to participate in a randomised controlled
      trial that compared mechanical removal of lice by a commercial kit every 3-4 days
      for 2 weeks with two applications of 0.5% malathion lotion 7 days apart; parents 
      carried out both treatments. The outcome measure was the presence of live lice 7 
      days after the end of treatment. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS:
      74 children completed the study and 72 were included in the analysis. The cure
      rate was 38% (12 of 32) for bug-busting and 78% (31 of 40) for malathion.
      Children assigned bug-busting were 2.8 (95% CI 1.5-5.2) times more likely than
      those assigned malathion to have lice at the end of treatment (p=0.0006).
      INTERPRETATION: Malathion lotion was twice as effective as bug-busting, even in
      an area with intermediate resistance. Policies advocating bug-busting as
      first-line treatment for head lice in the general population are inappropriate.
      Assessment of the outcome of treatment 1-2 weeks after completion is essential
      for successful management. Only about 50% of participants complied fully with
      treatment, so future trials should be pragmatic in design, avoid false
      incentives, and study representative samples of children.

TI  - Chemically assisted dissection of tissues: an interesting support in abdominal
      myomectomy.
PG  - 65-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to verify the efficacy of
      sodium-2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (mesna) in the chemical separation of tissues in
      abdominal myomectomies when used with the traditional mechanical separation
      techniques. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, randomized study, 58 women underwent 
      abdominal myomectomy. In 29 of these, we used mesna for highlighting and
      separating tissues, and in the other 29 we used saline solution for the same
      purposes. The variables evaluated included the number of myomas removed, the
      volume of the biggest myoma, and the total volume of the myomas removed in every 
      intervention. We also recorded operating time, the length of hospital stay, the
      degree of procedure difficulty, perioperative blood loss, operative
      complications, and cost. RESULTS: The operation was significantly shorter in the 
      mesna group (p < 0.05) even though the volume and the number of myomas were
      larger. The degree of difficulty evaluated by the surgeon at the end of every
      operation was not significantly different in the two groups. The reduction in
      hemoglobin 24 hours after operation was significantly less in the patients
      treated with mesna (p = 0.006), but this difference was probably altered by the
      increase in hematocrit levels. CONCLUSIONS: Because of its ability as a chemical 
      dissector, mesna may be a useful aid in this type of benign gynecologic
      operation. Larger studies to confirm this are needed.

      Cancer Study Group Trial VII.
PG  - 1412-22
AB  - PURPOSE: Information on the tolerability and efficacy of adjuvant chemoendocrine

      collected as part of the International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial VII.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with operable, node-positive breast
      cancer were randomized to receive either tamoxifen alone for 5 years (306
      patients) or tamoxifen plus three consecutive cycles of classical
      cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m(2) orally days 1 to 14), methotrexate (40 mg/m(2)
      intravenous days 1 and 8), and fluorouracil (600 mg/m(2) intravenous days 1 and
      8) every 28 days (CMF; 302 patients). The median follow-up was 8.0 years.
      RESULTS: Among the 299 patients who received at least one dose of CMF, women 65
      years of age or older (n = 76) had higher grades of toxicity compared with women 
      less than 65 years old (n = 223) (P =.004). More women in the older age group
      compared with the younger women experienced grade 3 toxicity of any type (17% v
      7%, respectively), grade 3 hematologic toxicity (9% v 5%, respectively), and
      grade 3 mucosal toxicity (4% v 1%, respectively). Older patients also received
      less than their expected CMF dose compared with younger postmenopausal women (P
      =.0008). The subjective burdens of treatment, however, were similar for younger
      and older patients based on quality-of-life measures (performance status, coping,
      physical well-being, mood, and appetite). For older patients, the 5-year
      disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 63% for CMF plus tamoxifen and 61% for
      tamoxifen alone (hazards ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 
      1.52; P =.99). For younger patients, the corresponding 5-year DFS rates were 61% 
      and 53% (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.91; P =.008), but the test for heterogeneity
      of CMF effect according to age group was not statistically significant. The
      reduced effectiveness of CMF among older women could not be attributed to dose
      reductions according to dose received. CONCLUSION: CMF tolerability and
      effectiveness were both reduced for older patients compared with younger
      postmenopausal node-positive breast cancer patients who received tamoxifen for 5 
      years. The development and evaluation of less toxic and more effective
      chemotherapy regimens are required for high-risk elderly patients.

TI  - Fluoxetine for depression in diabetes: a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 618-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Depression is prevalent in patients with diabetes. It is associated
      with poor glycemic control and is linked to an increased risk for diabetic
      complications. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of fluoxetine for
      depression in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty patients
      with diabetes (type 1, n = 26; type 2, n = 34) and major depressive disorder
      entered an 8-week randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Patients were
      given daily doses of fluoxetine (up to 40 mg/day). The Beck Depression Inventory 
      (BDI) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) were used to measure the
      severity of depression and to determine the percentage of patients who achieved
      substantial improvement or complete remission. GHb levels were obtained to
      monitor glycemic control. RESULTS: Reduction in depression symptoms was
      significantly greater in patients treated with fluoxetine compared with those
      receiving placebo (BDI, -14.0 vs. -8.8, P = 0.03; HAMD, -10.7 vs. -5.2, P =
      0.01). The percentage of patients achieving a significant improvement in
      depression per the BDI was also higher in the fluoxetine group (66.7 vs. 37.0%, P
      = 0.03). Additionally, trends toward a greater rate of depression remission (48.1
      vs. 25.9%, P = 0.09 per the HAMD) and greater reduction in GHb (-0.40 vs. -0.07%,
      P = 0.13) were observed in the fluoxetine group. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoxetine
      effectively reduces the severity of depression in diabetic patients. Our study
      demonstrated that after only 8 weeks, this treatment also produced a trend toward
      better glycemic control.

TI  - Early percutaneous coronary intervention, platelet inhibition with eptifibatide, 
      and clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes. PURSUIT
      Investigators.
PG  - 751-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonists prevent the composite
      end point of death or myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with acute coronary 
      syndromes. There is uncertainty about whether this effect is confined to patients
      who have percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) and whether PCIs further
      prevent death or MI in patients already treated with GP IIb/IIIa antagonists.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: PURSUIT patients were treated with the GP IIb/IIIa
      antagonist eptifibatide or placebo; PCIs were performed according to physician
      practices. In 2253 of 9641 patients (23.4%), PCI was performed by 30 days. Early 
      (<72 hours) PCI was performed in 1228 (12.7%). In 34 placebo patients (5.5%) and 
      10 treated with eptifibatide (1.7%) (P=0.001), MI preceded early PCI. In patients
      censored for PCI across the 30-day period, there was a significant reduction in
      the primary composite end point in eptifibatide patients (P=0.035). Eptifibatide 
      reduced 30-day events in patients who had early PCI (11.6% versus 16.7%, P=0.01) 
      and in patients who did not (14.6% versus 15.6%, P=0.23). After adjustment for
      PCI propensity, there was no evidence that eptifibatide treatment effect differed
      between patients with or without early PCI (P for interaction=0.634). PCI was not
      associated with a reduction of the primary composite end point but was associated
      with a reduced (nonspecified) composite of death or Q-wave MI. This association
      disappeared after adjustment for propensity for early PCI. CONCLUSIONS:
      Eptifibatide reduced the composite rates of death or MI in PCI patients and those
      managed conservatively.

TI  - The misoprostol third stage of labour study: a randomised controlled comparison
      between orally administered misoprostol and standard management.
PG  - 1104-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare misoprostol with standard oxytocic regimens in the
      prevention of postpartum haemorrhage. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial.
      SETTING: Obstetric unit in a large teaching hospital. METHODS: One thousand women
      randomised to 500 microg misoprostol given orally or to standard oxytocic
      regimens of oxytocin, oxytocin with ergometrine, or ergometrine. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Incidence of postpartum haemorrhage and the incidence and severity of
      side effects. RESULTS: Postpartum haemorrhage occurred in 12% of women given
      misoprostol and in 11% of women given standard oxytocic drugs (relative risk (RR)
      1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 1.55). Blood loss of 1000 mL or more
      occurred in 2% of women in each group. Nausea, headache, dizziness and tiredness 
      were less frequent with misoprostol (RR (95% CI) 0.71 (0.59, 0.84); 0.53 (0.38,
      0.74); 0.73 (0.61, 0.87) and 0.88 (0.83, 0.94) respectively). The main side
      effects of misoprostol were shivering (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.69, 2.25) and a rise in 
      temperature (difference in mean rise 0.34 degrees C, 95% CI 0.26, 0.42).
      CONCLUSION: Oral misoprostol for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage was
      comparable to standard oxytocics. Many side effects were less common with
      misoprostol but shivering and pyrexia were more common. Larger randomised trials 
      are needed before establishing the equivalence between misoprostol and standard
      oxytocic drugs in the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage.

TI  - A comparison between randomly alternating imaging, normal laparoscopic imaging,
      and virtual reality training in laparoscopic psychomotor skill acquisition.
PG  - 208-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate virtual reality as a laparoscopic training device in
      helping surgeons to automate to the "fulcrum effect" by comparing it to
      time-matched training programs using randomly alternating images (ie, y-axis
      inverted and normal laparoscopic) and normal laparoscopic viewing conditions.
      METHODS: Twenty-four participants (16 females and 8 males), were randomly
      assigned to minimally invasive surgery virtual reality (MIST VR), randomly
      alternating (between y-axis inverted and normal laparoscopic images), and normal 
      laparoscopic imaging condition. Participants were requested to perform a 2-minute
      laparoscopic cutting task before and after training. RESULTS: In the test trial
      participants who trained on the MIST VR performed significantly better than those
      in the normal laparoscopic and randomly alternating imaging conditions.
      CONCLUSION: The results show that virtual reality training may provide faster
      skill acquisition with particular reference to automation of the fulcrum effect. 
      MIST VR provides a new way of training laparoscopic psychomotor surgical skills.

TI  - Novel dosing regimen of eptifibatide in planned coronary stent implantation
      (ESPRIT): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 2037-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: The platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, although effective in 
      reducing ischaemic complications of percutaneous coronary intervention, are used 
      in few coronary stent implantation procedures. ESPRIT (Enhanced Suppression of
      the Platelet IIb/IIIa Receptor with Integrilin Therapy) is a randomised,
      placebo-controlled trial to assess whether a novel, double-bolus dose of
      eptifibatide could improve outcomes of patients undergoing coronary stenting.
      METHODS: We recruited 2064 patients undergoing stent implantation in a native
      coronary artery. Immediately before percutaneous coronary intervention, patients 
      were randomly allocated to receive eptifibatide, given as two 180 microg/kg
      boluses 10 min apart and a continuous infusion of 2.0 microg/kg/min for 18-24 h, 
      or placebo, in addition to aspirin, heparin, and a thienopyridine. The primary
      endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel 
      revascularisation, and thrombotic bailout glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy
      within 48 h after randomisation. The key secondary endpoint was the composite of 
      death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularisation at 30
      days. FINDINGS: The trial was terminated early for efficacy. The primary endpoint
      was reduced from 10.5% (108 of 1024 patients on placebo [95% CI 8.7-12.4%]) to
      6.6% (69 of 1040 [5.1-8.1%]) with treatment (p=0.0015). The key 30 day secondary 
      endpoint was also reduced, from 10.5% (107 of 1024 patients on placebo
      [8.6-12.3%]) to 6.8% (71 of 1040 [5.3-8.4%]; p=0.0034). There was consistency in 
      reduction of events across all components of the composite endpoint and among the
      major subgroups. Major bleeding was infrequent but arose more often with
      eptifibatide than placebo (1.3%, 13 of 1040 [0.7-2.1%]) vs 0.4%, 4 of 1024
      [0.1-1.0%]; p=0.027). INTERPRETATION: Routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor
      pretreatment with eptifibatide substantially reduces ischaemic complications in
      coronary stent intervention and is better than a strategy of reserving treatment 
      to the bailout situation.

TI  - An immune-enhancing enteral diet reduces mortality rate and episodes of
      bacteremia in septic intensive care unit patients.
PG  - 643-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether early enteral feeding in a septic intensive care 
      unit (ICU) population, using a formula supplemented with arginine, mRNA, and
      omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil (Impact), improves clinical outcomes, when
      compared with a common use, high protein enteral feed without these nutrients.
      DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, multicentered trial. SETTING: ICUs of six
      hospitals in Spain. PATIENTS: One hundred eighty-one septic patients (122 males, 
      59 females) presenting for enteral nutrition in an ICU. INTERVENTIONS: Septic ICU
      patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores
      of > or =10 received either an enteral feed enriched with arginine, mRNA, and
      omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil (Impact), or a common use, high protein control
      feed (Precitene Hiperproteico). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred
      seventy-six (89 Impact patients, 87 control subjects) were eligible for
      intention-to-treat analysis. The mortality rate was reduced for the treatment
      group compared with the control group (17 of 89 vs. 28 of 87; p < .05).
      Bacteremias were reduced in the treatment group (7 of 89 vs. 19 of 87; p = .01)
      as well as the number of patients with more than one nosocomial infection (5 of
      89 vs. 17 of 87; p = .01). The benefit in mortality rate for the treatment group 
      was more pronounced for patients with APACHE II scores between 10 and 15 (1 of 26
      vs. 8 of 29; p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Immune-enhancing enteral nutrition resulted
      in a significant reduction in the mortality rate and infection rate in septic
      patients admitted to the ICU. These reductions were greater for patients with
      less severe illness.

TI  - Basal insulin glargine (HOE 901) versus NPH insulin in patients with type 1
      diabetes on multiple daily insulin regimens. U.S. Insulin Glargine (HOE 901) Type
      1 Diabetes Investigator Group.
PG  - 1137-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin glargine (HOE 901, 21(A)-Gly-30(B)a-L-Arg-30(B)b-L-Arg human
      insulin) is a novel recombinant analog of human insulin with a shift in the
      isoelectric point producing a retarded absorption rate and an increased duration 
      of action that closely mimics normal basal insulin secretion. It recently
      received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate 2 formulations of insulin glargine for safety and efficacy in the
      treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a
      4-week trial, 256 patients with type 1 diabetes received either NPH insulin or
      insulin glargine containing 30 microg/ml zinc (insulin glargine[30]) or 80
      microg/ml zinc (insulin glargine[80]). Insulin glargine was given subcutaneously 
      once daily at bedtime. NPH insulin was given either once daily (at bedtime) or
      twice daily (before breakfast and at bedtime), according to the patient's
      prestudy regimen. The initial doses of insulin glargine and NPH were based on the
      previous NPH total daily dose. RESULTS: At study end point, insulin
      glargine-pooled groups had significantly lower fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
      levels than the NPH insulin group, with adjusted mean FPG levels reduced by 2.2
      mmol/l (P = 0.0001). Insulin glargine was superior to NPH insulin in reducing FPG
      levels in patients who had previously received NPH insulin twice daily but not in
      patients who had previously received NPH once daily. FPG levels were more stable 
      in patients using insulin glargine than in patients using NPH insulin. A subset
      of patients (n = 71) underwent hourly overnight plasma glucose measurements.
      Insulin glargine patients exhibited lower FPG levels after 5:00 A.M.; the
      difference was significant by 8:00 A.M. The adjusted mean FPG for insulin
      glargine[30] was 7.8 mmol/l; for insulin glargine[80], 7.3 mmol/l; and for NPH,
      10.7 mmol/l. Both formulations of insulin glargine were well tolerated, similar
      to NPH insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Basal insulin glargine administered once daily for 4
      weeks as part of a basal-bolus multiple daily insulin regimen was safe and more
      effective in lowering fasting plasma glucose levels than NPH in patients with
      type 1 diabetes.

TI  - Randomised comparison of the effectiveness and costs of community and hospital
      based mental health services for children with behavioural disorders.
PG  - 1047-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a community based intervention by
      secondary child and adolescent mental health services would be significantly more
      effective and less costly than a hospital based intervention. DESIGN: Open study 
      with two randomised parallel groups. SETTING: Two health districts in the north
      of England. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of 3 to 10 year old children with behavioural
      disorder who had been referred to child and adolescent mental health services.
      INTERVENTION: Parental education groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parents' and
      teachers' reports of the child's behaviour, parental depression, parental
      criticism of the child, impact of the child's behaviour on the family. RESULTS:
      141 subjects were randomised to community (n=72) or hospital (n=69) treatment.
      Primary outcome data were obtained on 115 (82%) cases a year later. Intention to 
      treat analyses showed no significant differences between the community and
      hospital based groups on any of the outcome measures, or on costs. Parental
      depression was common and predicted the child's outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Location of
      child mental health services may be less important than the range of services
      that they provide, which should include effective treatment for parents' mental
      health problems.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy for
      migraine.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy
      (SMT) in the treatment of migraine. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of 6
      months' duration. The trial consisted of 3 stages: 2 months of data collection
      (before treatment), 2 months of treatment, and a further 2 months of data
      collection (after treatment). Comparison of outcomes to the initial baseline
      factors was made at the end of the 6 months for both an SMT group and a control
      group. SETTING: Chiropractic Research Center of Macquarie University.
      PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-seven volunteers between the ages of 10 and 70
      years were recruited through media advertising. The diagnosis of migraine was
      made on the basis of the International Headache Society standard, with a minimum 
      of at least one migraine per month. INTERVENTIONS: Two months of chiropractic SMT
      (diversified technique) at vertebral fixations determined by the practitioner
      (maximum of 16 treatments). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed
      standard headache diaries during the entire trial noting the frequency, intensity
      (visual analogue score), duration, disability, associated symptoms, and use of
      medication for each migraine episode. RESULTS: The average response of the
      treatment group (n = 83) showed statistically significant improvement in migraine
      frequency (P < .005), duration (P < .01), disability (P < .05), and medication
      use (P< .001) when compared with the control group (n = 40). Four persons failed 
      to complete the trial because of a variety of causes, including change in
      residence, a motor vehicle accident, and increased migraine frequency. Expressed 
      in other terms, 22% of participants reported more than a 90% reduction of
      migraines as a consequence of the 2 months of SMT. Approximately 50% more
      participants reported significant improvement in the morbidity of each episode.
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study support previous results showing that some 
      people report significant improvement in migraines after chiropractic SMT. A high
      percentage (>80%) of participants reported stress as a major factor for their
      migraines. It appears probable that chiropractic care has an effect on the
      physical conditions related to stress and that in these people the effects of the
      migraine are reduced.

TI  - Complications of hysteroscopic surgery: predicting patients at risk.
PG  - 517-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of operative complications and whether they
      can be predicted by specific patient characteristics or type of hysteroscopic
      procedure. METHODS: We collected demographic and medical history information on
      925 women who had hysteroscopies from 1995 through 1996. We compared differences 
      in rates of operative complications of specific hysteroscopic procedures.
      Operative complications were defined as uterine perforation, excessive glycine
      absorption (1 L or more), hyponatremia, hemorrhage (500 mL or more), bowel or
      bladder injury, inability to dilate the cervix, and procedure-related hospital
      admissions. RESULTS: Operative complications occurred in 25 (2.7%) of 925
      hysteroscopies. Excessive fluid absorption was the most frequent complication.
      Hysteroscopic myomectomy and resection of uterine septum were associated with
      greater odds of complications (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      3.3, 16.6 and OR 4.0, 95% CI 0.9, 19.6, respectively). Hysteroscopic polypectomy 
      and endometrial ablation were associated with lower odds of complications (OR
      0.1, 95% CI 0.0, 0.7 and OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1, 3.3, respectively). Hysteroscopies
      done by reproductive endocrinologists and preoperative GnRH agonist therapy were 
      associated with 4-7 times higher odds for operative complications. CONCLUSION:
      Complications during hysteroscopic surgery are rare. Among hysteroscopic
      procedures, myomectomies and resections of uterine septa have significantly
      higher rates of complications, especially excessive fluid absorption. Meticulous 
      fluid management might limit the number of serious complications of these
      higher-risk procedures.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of clozapine compared with conventional antipsychotic
      medication for patients in state hospitals.
PG  - 987-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: An open-label, randomized controlled trial compared clozapine with
      physicians'-choice medications among long-term state hospital inpatients in
      Connecticut. The goal was to examine clozapine's cost-effectiveness in routine
      practice for people experiencing lengthy hospitalizations. METHODS: Long-stay
      patients with schizophrenia in a state hospital were randomly assigned to begin
      open-label clozapine (n = 138) or to continue receiving conventional
      antipsychotic medications (n = 89). We interviewed study participants every 4
      months for 2 years to assess psychiatric symptoms and functional status, and we
      collected continuous measures of prescribed medications, service utilization, and
      other costs. We used both parametric and nonparametric techniques to examine
      changes in cost and parametric analyses to examine changes in effectiveness. We
      used bootstrap techniques to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and
      create cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Both groups incurred
      similar costs during the 2-year study period, with a trend for clozapine to be
      less costly than usual care in the second study year. Clozapine was more
      effective than usual care on many but not all measures. With the use of
      effectiveness measures that favored clozapine (extrapyramidal side effects,
      disruptiveness), bootstrap techniques indicated that, even when a payer is
      unwilling to incur any additional cost for gains in effectiveness, the
      probability that clozapine is more cost-effective than usual care is at least
      0.80. These findings were not as evident when outcomes where clozapine was not
      clearly superior (psychotic symptoms, weight gain) were examined. CONCLUSION:
      Clozapine demonstrated cost-effectiveness on some but not all measures of
      effectiveness when the alternative was a range of conventional antipsychotic
      medications.

TI  - A 2-year follow-up of the effectiveness of traditional child psychotherapy.
PG  - 1094-101
AB  - This study examined outcomes at a 2-year follow-up assessment for child
      psychotherapy as it typically is delivered in outpatient settings. The treatment 
      condition (53 children, mean age = 10.5 years) and control condition (53
      children, mean age = 10.0 years) were compared with regard to rates of linear and
      curvilinear change for psychopathology, adaptive functioning, and consumer
      satisfaction. Although both conditions showed curvilinear as well as linear
      improvement in behavioral and emotional problems, relatively little support was
      found for the effectiveness of traditional child psychotherapy or for the
      presence of a psychotherapy "sleeper effect."

TI  - Ondansetron versus placebo for prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in patients
      undergoing ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
PG  - 60-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a common problem in patients
      undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron given at the induction of anesthesia in
      patients scheduled for ambulatory LC. METHODS: A total of 84 patients undergoing 
      ambulatory LC were enrolled in a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study in
      which the subjects received either placebo or 4 mg ondansetron intravenously at
      induction of anesthesia. A nausea scoring system was employed utilizing a 5-point
      linear scale, with 1 point given for no nausea and a maximum of 5 points for an
      episode of emesis. Each patient received a total of four scores postoperatively. 
      RESULTS: The patients receiving placebo had significantly more episodes of nausea
      (53 versus 32; P <0.009) and emesis (11 versus 2; P <0.02), higher mean total
      nausea scores (7.2 versus 5.4; P <0.006), and need for additional postoperative
      antiemetics (23 versus 14; P <0.05) than those receiving ondansetron.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
      ondansetron at induction was highly effective in decreasing postoperative nausea 
      and vomiting and should become the standard.

TI  - Effectiveness and safety of a nonremovable fiberglass off-bearing cast versus a
      therapeutic shoe in the treatment of neuropathic foot ulcers: a randomized study.
PG  - 1746-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the rate of reduction of the surface area of
      neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetic patients treated with nonremovable
      rigidity-differentiated fiberglass off-bearing casts or a cloth shoe with a rigid
      sole with unloading alkaform insoles. The secondary aim was to evaluate the side 
      effects and degree of patient acceptance of treatment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Fifty diabetic patients with neuropathic plantar ulcers were
      consecutively enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment groups. Of the 50
      patients, 24 were treated with a specialized cloth shoe with a rigid sole and an 
      unloading alkaform insole (shoe group), and 26 patients were treated with a
      nonremovable off-bearing fiberglass cast (cast group). All patients in both study
      groups returned to the clinic for weekly control visits. Their ulcers were
      treated with a standard dressing. Tracings of the ulcer area using a transparent 
      dressing were performed on the day of entry to the study and after 30 days of
      treatment. The presence of new ulcerations caused by the use of the
      pressure-relief apparatus was recorded. Patient acceptance of the treatment was
      measured using a visual analog scale. RESULTS: At the end of the treatment
      period, an 8.3% increase of the ulcer area was observed in two patients in the
      shoe group, whereas in the cast group, no patient presented an increase. The
      reduction of the ulcer area was statistically more rapid in the cast group
      (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.0004). Furthermore, the number of ulcers completely
      healed at the 30-day time point was 13 (50%) in the cast group and 5 (20.8%) in
      the shoe group (P = 0.03). In both groups, no side effects were recorded. The
      average score +/- SD of patient acceptance was 91.15 +/- 9.9 in the shoe group
      and 88.33 +/- 17.3 (NS) in the cast group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown a
      significant difference in the speed of the reduction of neuropathic plantar
      ulcers treated with a fiberglass cast compared with a specialized cloth shoe. The
      use of fiberglass material with variable rigidity has also shown two important
      results: the elimination of side effects including ulcers caused by the cast, and
      high patient acceptance. These data show that the use of off-bearing casts made
      with fiberglass bandages of variable rigidity is the elective treatment of
      neuropathic plantar ulcers.

TI  - Two years of intensive glycemic control and left ventricular function in the
      Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (VA CSDM).
PG  - 1316-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (VA
      CSDM) was a multicenter randomized prospective study of 153 male type 2 diabetic 
      patients to assess the ability to sustain clinically significant glycemic
      separation between intensive and standard treatment arms. A trend toward an
      excess of combined cardiovascular events in the intensive treatment arm of this
      trial was reported earlier. The present analysis was done to evaluate the effect 
      of 2 years of intensive glycemic control on the left ventricular (LV) function.
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patients were randomized to intensive step
      treatment with insulin alone or with sulfonylurea (intensive treatment arm [INT],
      n = 75) or to standard once-daily insulin injection (standard treatment arm
      [STD], n = 78) treatment. A total of 136 patients (standard treatment arm [STD], 
      n = 70; INT, n = 66) had radionuclide ventriculography at entry and at 24 months 
      for the assessment of LV function. RESULTS: There was no difference in the mean
      LV ejection fraction (at entry: STD 57.1+/-9.51%; INT 58.1+/-8.7%; at 24 months: 
      STD 57.3+/-10.8%, INT 59.5+/-10.7%), peak filling rate (at entry: STD 2.6+/-0.7
      end diastolic volume per second, INT 2.4+/-0.8 end diastolic volume per second;
      at 24 months: STD 2.7+/-1.0 end diastolic volume per second, INT 2.5+/-0.7 end
      diastolic volume per second), or time to peak filling rate (at entry: STD
      195.3+/-69.5 ms, INT 185.6 +/-62.4 ms; at 24 months: STD 182.6+/-64.8 ms, INT
      179.2+/-61.2 ms) between the 2 treatment arms. A subgroup analysis of 104
      patients (STD, n = 53; INT, n = 51) that omitted individuals with intervening
      cardiac events/revascularization or a change in cardioactive medications also
      showed no difference in the LV function at entry and at 24 months between the 2
      groups. Abnormal LV ejection fraction at baseline predicted cardiac events
      (interval between cardiac beats [RR] = 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Two years of intensive 
      glycemic control does not affect the LV systolic or diastolic function in
      patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Nurse management of patients with minor illnesses in general practice:
      multicentre, randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1038-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability and safety of a minor illness service led 
      by practice nurses in general practice. DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised
      controlled trial. SETTING: 5 general practices in south east London and Kent
      representing semi-rural, suburban, and urban settings. PARTICIPANTS: 1815
      patients requesting and offered same day appointments by receptionists.
      INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to treatment by either a specially trained
      nurse or a general practitioner. Patients seen by a nurse were referred to a
      general practitioner when appropriate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The general
      satisfaction of the patients as measured by the consultation satisfaction
      questionnaire. Other outcome measures included the length of the consultation,
      number of prescriptions written, rates of referral to general practitioners,
      patient's reported health status, patient's anticipated behaviour in seeking
      health care in future, and number of patients who returned to the surgery, visits
      to accident and emergency, and out of hours calls to doctors. RESULTS: Patients
      were very satisfied with both nurses and doctors, but they were significantly
      more satisfied with their consultations with nurses (mean (SD) score of
      satisfaction 78.6 (16. 0) of 100 points for nurses v 76.4 (17.8) for doctors; 95%
      confidence interval for difference between means -4.07 to -0.38). Consultations
      with nurses took about 10 minutes compared with about 8 minutes for consultations
      with doctors. Nurses and doctors wrote prescriptions for a similar proportion of 
      patients (nurses 481/736 (65.4%) v doctors 518/816 (63.5%)). 577/790 (73%)
      patients seen by nurses were managed without any input from doctors. CONCLUSION: 
      Practice nurses seem to offer an effective service for patients with minor
      illnesses who request same day appointments.

TI  - Open versus closed kinetic chain exercises for patellofemoral pain. A
      prospective, randomized study.
PG  - 687-94
AB  - The goal of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of open versus
      closed kinetic chain exercises in the nonoperative management of patellofemoral
      pain. Sixty patients were randomized into a 5-week program that consisted of only
      closed kinetic chain exercises or only open kinetic chain exercises. Muscle
      characteristics, subjective symptoms, and functional performance were evaluated
      in this study at the time of the initial physical examination, at the end of the 
      treatment period, and 3 months later. Both groups experienced a statistically
      significant decrease in pain and an increase in functional performance. This
      study shows that both open and closed kinetic chain exercise programs lead to an 
      improved subjective and clinical outcome in patients with anterior knee pain. The
      few significantly better functional results for some of the tested parameters in 
      the closed kinetic chain group suggest that this type of treatment is a little
      more effective than the open kinetic chain program in the treatment of these
      patients.

TI  - Ciprofibrate therapy improves endothelial function and reduces postprandial
      lipemia and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1773-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exaggerated postprandial lipemia (PPL) is a factor in atherogenesis, 
      involving endothelial dysfunction and enhanced oxidative stress. We examined the 
      effect of ciprofibrate therapy on these parameters in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients entered a 3-month, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. Each subject was studied fasting and after a fatty
      meal, at baseline, and after 3 months of treatment. Glucose and lipid profiles
      were measured over an 8-hour postprandial period. Endothelial function
      (flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation [FMD]) and oxidative stress
      (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) were measured after fasting and 4 
      hours postprandially. At baseline, both groups exhibited similar PPL and
      deterioration in endothelial function. After ciprofibrate, fasting and
      postprandial FMD values were significantly higher (from 3.8+/-1. 8% and
      1.8+/-1.3% to 4.8+/-1.1% and 3.4+/-1.1%; P<0.05). This was mirrored by a fall in 
      fasting and postprandial triglycerides (3. 1+/-2.1 and 6.6+/-4.1 mmol/L to
      1.5+/-0.8 and 2.8+/-1.3 mmol/L, P<0. 05). Fasting and postprandial HDL
      cholesterol was also elevated (0. 9+/-0.1 and 0.8+/-0.1 mmol/L and 1.2+/-0.2 and 
      1.2+/-0.1 mmol/L, P<0. 05). There were no changes in total or LDL cholesterol.
      Fasting and postprandial triglyceride enrichment of all lipoproteins was
      attenuated, with cholesterol depletion of VLDL and enrichment of HDL. There were 
      similar postprandial increases in oxidative stress in both groups at baseline,
      which was significantly attenuated by ciprofibrate (0.3+/-0.6 versus 1.5+/-1.1 U,
      P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that fibrate therapy improves
      fasting and postprandial endothelial function in type 2 diabetes. Attenuation of 
      PPL and the associated oxidative stress, with increased HDL cholesterol levels,
      may be important.

      clinical effectiveness.
PG  - 1383-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness of general practitioner care and
      two general practice based psychological therapies for depressed patients.
      DESIGN: Prospective, controlled trial with randomised and patient preference
      allocation arms. SETTING: General practices in London and greater Manchester.
      PARTICIPANTS: 464 of 627 patients presenting with depression or mixed anxiety and
      depression were suitable for inclusion. INTERVENTIONS: Usual general practitioner
      care or up to 12 sessions of non-directive counselling or cognitive-behaviour
      therapy provided by therapists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Beck depression inventory 
      scores, other psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and satisfaction with
      treatment measured at baseline and at 4 and 12 months. RESULTS: 197 patients were
      randomly assigned to treatment, 137 chose their treatment, and 130 were
      randomised only between the two psychological therapies. All groups improved
      significantly over time. At four months, patients randomised to non-directive
      counselling or cognitive-behaviour therapy improved more in terms of the Beck
      depression inventory (mean (SD) scores 12.9 (9.3) and 14.3 (10.8) respectively)
      than those randomised to usual general practitioner care (18.3 (12.4)). However, 
      there was no significant difference between the two therapies. There were no
      significant differences between the three treatment groups at 12 months (Beck
      depression scores 11.8 (9.6), 11.4 (10.8), and 12.1 (10.3) for non-directive
      counselling, cognitive-behaviour therapy, and general practitioner care).
      CONCLUSIONS: Psychological therapy was a more effective treatment for depression 
      than usual general practitioner care in the short term, but after one year there 
      was no difference in outcome.

TI  - Predictors of mortality and mortality from cardiac causes in the bypass
      angioplasty revascularization investigation (BARI) randomized trial and registry.
      For the BARI Investigators.
PG  - 2682-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
      and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on long-term mortality rates in the
      presence of various demographic, clinical, and angiographic factors is uncertain 
      in the population of patients suitable for both procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      In the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI) randomized trial
      and registry, 3610 patients who were eligible to receive PTCA and CABG were
      revascularized between 1989 and 1992. Multivariate Cox models were used to
      identify factors associated with 5-year mortality and cardiac mortality, with
      particular attention to factors that interact with treatment. Diabetic patients
      receiving insulin had higher mortality and cardiac mortality rates with PTCA
      compared with CABG (relative risk [RR] 1.78 and 2.63, respectively, P<0.001), and
      patients with ST elevation had higher cardiac mortality rates with CABG than with
      PTCA (RR 4.08, P<0.001). Factors most strongly associated with high overall
      mortality rates were insulin-treated diabetes, congestive heart failure, kidney
      failure, and older age. Black race was also associated with higher mortality
      rates (RR 1.49, P=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: A set of variables was identified that
      could be used to help select a revascularization procedure and to evaluate risk
      of long-term mortality in the population of patients considering
      revascularization.

TI  - Influence of a nonionic, iso-osmolar contrast medium (iodixanol) versus an ionic,
      low-osmolar contrast medium (ioxaglate) on major adverse cardiac events in
      patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: A
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. Visipaque in Percutaneous
      Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty [VIP] Trial Investigators.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential merits and disadvantages of the use of ionic or
      nonionic contrast media in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary
      angioplasty (PTCA) have been the subjects of controversy. The present study was
      designed to evaluate the possible influence of both types of contrast media on
      major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients undergoing PTCA. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: In a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study, 1411 patients
      received either iodixanol (a nonionic, iso-osmolar contrast medium) or ioxaglate 
      (an ionic, low-osmolar contrast medium) during PTCA. A standardized
      anticoagulation regimen was followed. Patients were monitored in the hospital for
      2 days and followed-up at 1 month. The primary end point, a composite of MACE
      (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, and
      re-PTCA) after 2 days, occurred in 4.3% of the total population, with no
      statistically significant difference between groups (iodixanol, 4.7%; ioxaglate, 
      3.9%; P=0.45). Further, between 2-day and 1-month follow-ups, no significant
      difference (P=0.27) existed between the groups in the rates of MACE.
      Hypersensitivity reactions (P=0.007) and adverse drug reactions (P=0.002) were
      significantly less frequent in the iodixanol group. The only significant
      predicting factors for the occurrence of MACE were dissection/abrupt closure and 
      country. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed between the
      iodixanol and ioxaglate groups with regard to MACE, although hypersensitivity and
      adverse drug reactions were significantly less frequent in patients who received 
      iodixanol.

TI  - Randomized double blind trial of an ayurvedic plant derived formulation for
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1365-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate RA-1, a standardized plant extract formulation,
      traditionally considered a safe, effective antiarthritic in the Asian-Indian
      Ayurvedic medicinal system. METHODS: One hundred eighty-two patients with
      active-on-chronic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) participated in a 16 week randomized,
      double blind, placebo controlled, parallel efficacy clinical drug trial in Pune, 
      India. Tenderness, pain, swelling, and several other efficacy measures were
      assessed by (1) ACR core set 20% and 50% improvement; (2) ACR 20% improvement
      response. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed; p<0.05 considered
      significant. RESULTS: Seventeen patients withdrew (active = 9; placebo = 8); none
      withdrew due to drug toxicity. An unprecedented placebo response (often p<0.001
      in within-group change) was observed. The active RA-1 group remained numerically 
      superior at all evaluation timepoints. RA-1 demonstrated few significant
      differences: (1) increased proportion with 50% reduction in swollen joint count
      (95% CI approximately 1.52, 29.90) and swollen joint score (95% CI approximately 
      0.91, 28.73); (2) reduced rheumatoid factor (95% CI approximately -303.7, -2.72);
      39% in the RA-1 group versus 30% placebo showed ACR 20% improvement (95% CI
      approximately -5.48, 24.59). Only minor side effects were seen, with no
      significant differences by treatment group. CONCLUSION: In a trial with
      sufficient power, RA-1 revealed efficacy that was not significantly superior to
      the strong placebo response, except for improvement in joint swelling. Further,
      the effect on RF and good safety profile led to an open label phase.

TI  - Demonstration of in vivo bioequivalence of a generic albuterol metered-dose
      inhaler to Ventolin.
PG  - 714-21
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To use histamine bronchoprovocation and bioassay statistical
      procedures to evaluate the in vivo bioequivalence of a generic albuterol
      metered-dose inhaler (MDI). DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, balanced,
      crossover design was used to determine the potency of each generic albuterol MDI 
      actuation relative to Ventolin (Glaxo Wellcome; Research Triangle Park, NC)
      administration. One treatment was administered on each of 4 study days. A
      histamine bronchoprovocation procedure was initiated 1.25 h before and 15 min
      after administration of the study treatment. PATIENTS: Twenty-four nonsmoking
      subjects with mild-to-moderate asthma were studied (18 to 65 years of age;
      FEV(1), > 60% of predicted; and provocative concentration of histamine causing a 
      20% fall in FEV(1) [PC(20)], < or = 8 mg/mL at screening). INTERVENTIONS: One and
      four actuations (90 and 360 microg, respectively) of the generic MDI and of
      Ventolin MDI. Placebo inhalers were used to maintain blinding of inhaler and
      doses. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The primary outcome variable was histamine
      PC(20) measured after study treatment administration. A significant dose-effect
      relationship was present (p < 0.0001). Deviation from parallelism of the generic 
      and Ventolin dose-response curves (p = 0.95) and differences in overall mean
      response between the two formulations (p = 0.68) were not significant. Using
      Finney 2 x 2 bioassay statistical procedures, we estimated that one actuation of 
      the generic albuterol MDI was equivalent to 1.01 puffs of Ventolin (90%
      confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.50). CONCLUSION: The generic albuterol MDI
      delivers a quantity of albuterol to the beta(2)-receptor site in the lung that is
      the bioequivalent to Ventolin. Further, this study reinforces the validity of
      this statistical methodology for determining in vivo bioequivalence.

TI  - Comparison of usefulness of estradiol vaginal tablets and estriol vagitories for 
      treatment of vaginal atrophy.
PG  - 293-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrophic vaginitis is a common condition. This study compared the
      usefulness of estradiol vaginal tablets (EVT) and estriol vagitories (EV) in
      treatment of atrophic vaginitis. METHODS: Ninety-six postmenopausal women with
      symptoms of atrophic vaginitis were treated for 24 weeks with either EVT or with 
      EV. Patients used the medication daily for the first 2 weeks of the study, and
      twice-weekly thereafter. RESULTS: Both EVT and EV were effective in treating
      vaginal atrophy and patients in both treatment groups experienced a significant
      improvement in vaginal symptoms such as itching, irritation, dryness, and
      dyspareunia. At the end of the study three (6%) EVT treated women reported
      leakage and none needed to use sanitary towels. Among the EV treated women 31
      (65%) reported leakage and 14 (29%) required sanitary protection. Furthermore,
      90% in the EVT group perceived the medication as hygienic compared to 79% in the 
      EV group, and 49% in the EVT group indicated that the product was easy to use
      compared to 28% in the EV group. Endometrial thickness was increased (1.1 mm with
      EVT and 0.5 mm on EV) in both treatment groups during the first 2 weeks of the
      study, but returned to baseline levels when the frequency of drug application was
      reduced to twice-weekly. CONCLUSIONS: Estradiol vaginal tablets provides an
      effective alternative to traditional forms of local estrogen therapy.

TI  - A comparison of continuous thalamic stimulation and thalamotomy for suppression
      of severe tremor.
PG  - 461-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep-brain stimulation through an electrode implanted in the thalamus
      was developed as an alternative to thalamotomy for the treatment of
      drug-resistant tremor. Stimulation is thought to be as effective as thalamotomy
      but to have fewer complications. We examined the effects of these two procedures 
      on the functional abilities of patients with drug-resistant tremor due to
      Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, or multiple sclerosis. METHODS:
      Sixty-eight patients (45 with Parkinson's disease, 13 with essential tremor, and 
      10 with multiple sclerosis) were randomly assigned to undergo thalamotomy or
      thalamic stimulation. The primary outcome measure was the change in functional
      abilities six months after surgery, as measured by the Frenchay Activities Index.
      Scores for this index can range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating
      better function. Secondary outcome measures were the severity of tremor, the
      number of adverse effects, and patients' assessment of the outcome. RESULTS:
      Functional status improved more in the thalamic-stimulation group than in the
      thalamotomy group, as indicated by increases in the score for the Frenchay
      Activities Index (from 31.4 to 36.3 and from 32.0 to 32.5, respectively;
      difference between groups, 4.4 points; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to
      6.9). After adjustment for base-line characteristics, multivariate analysis also 
      showed that the thalamic-stimulation group had greater improvement (difference
      between groups, 5.1 points; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 7.9). Tremor
      was suppressed completely or almost completely in 27 of 34 patients in the
      thalamotomy group and in 30 of 33 patients in the thalamic-stimulation group. One
      patient in the thalamic-stimulation group died perioperatively after an
      intracerebral hemorrhage. With the exception of this incident, thalamic
      stimulation was associated with significantly fewer adverse effects than
      thalamotomy. Functional status was reported as improved by 8 patients in the
      thalamotomy group, as compared with 18 patients in the thalamic-stimulation group
      (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Thalamic stimulation and thalamotomy are equally effective
      for the suppression of drug-resistant tremor, but thalamic stimulation has fewer 
      adverse effects and results in a greater improvement in function.

TI  - Complications of hysteroscopic surgery: predicting patients at risk.
PG  - 517-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of operative complications and whether they
      can be predicted by specific patient characteristics or type of hysteroscopic
      procedure. METHODS: We collected demographic and medical history information on
      925 women who had hysteroscopies from 1995 through 1996. We compared differences 
      in rates of operative complications of specific hysteroscopic procedures.
      Operative complications were defined as uterine perforation, excessive glycine
      absorption (1 L or more), hyponatremia, hemorrhage (500 mL or more), bowel or
      bladder injury, inability to dilate the cervix, and procedure-related hospital
      admissions. RESULTS: Operative complications occurred in 25 (2.7%) of 925
      hysteroscopies. Excessive fluid absorption was the most frequent complication.
      Hysteroscopic myomectomy and resection of uterine septum were associated with
      greater odds of complications (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      3.3, 16.6 and OR 4.0, 95% CI 0.9, 19.6, respectively). Hysteroscopic polypectomy 
      and endometrial ablation were associated with lower odds of complications (OR
      0.1, 95% CI 0.0, 0.7 and OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1, 3.3, respectively). Hysteroscopies
      done by reproductive endocrinologists and preoperative GnRH agonist therapy were 
      associated with 4-7 times higher odds for operative complications. CONCLUSION:
      Complications during hysteroscopic surgery are rare. Among hysteroscopic
      procedures, myomectomies and resections of uterine septa have significantly
      higher rates of complications, especially excessive fluid absorption. Meticulous 
      fluid management might limit the number of serious complications of these
      higher-risk procedures.

TI  - Treatment of carcinoid syndrome: a prospective crossover evaluation of lanreotide
      versus octreotide in terms of efficacy, patient acceptability, and tolerance.
PG  - 770-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The somatostatin analogues lanreotide and octreotide have previously 
      been shown to be effective in controlling flushing and diarrhea in patients with 
      carcinoid syndrome. As lanreotide requires injection only every 10 days, compared
      with twice-daily injections of octreotide, a direct comparison between these two 
      treatments in terms of patient acceptability, patient preference, and efficacy in
      controlling symptoms was performed in patients with carcinoid syndrome. METHODS: 
      Thirty-three patients with carcinoid syndrome were included in an open,
      multicenter, crossover study. Half of the patients received octreotide 200 microg
      subcutaneously twice or thrice daily for 1 month followed by lanreotide 30 mg
      intramuscularly every 10 days for 1 month, while the other half commenced with
      lanreotide followed by octreotide in a similar fashion. Quality-of-life
      assessments were performed at each visit and patient preference for one of the
      two treatments evaluated. The number and intensity of flushing episodes and bowel
      movements, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) levels, and plasma
      serotonin levels were recorded. RESULTS: No significant differences were found
      between lanreotide and octreotide in terms of quality of life. The majority of
      patients (68%) preferred lanreotide (P = 0.03), largely due to its simplified
      mode of administration. Disappearance or improvement in flushes occurred in 53.8%
      of patients (14 of 26) while on lanreotide and in 68% (17 of 25) on octreotide. A
      disappearance or improvement of diarrhea in 45.4% (10 of 22) on lanreotide,
      compared with 50% (11 of 22) on octreotide, was also observed. Lanreotide and
      octreotide were equally effective in reducing urinary 5HIAA levels and plasma
      serotonin levels. Both treatments were well tolerated, with mild symptoms of
      abdominal pain and nausea observed in 29% and 14% receiving octreotide and
      lanreotide, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lanreotide and octreotide are equally
      efficacious in terms of symptom control and reduction in tumor cell markers for
      patients with carcinoid syndrome. Due to its simplified mode of administration,
      most patients prefer treatment with lanreotide.

TI  - First-night effect of melatonin treatment in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 691-4
AB  - The first-night effect (FNE) is the tendency for individuals to sleep worse than 
      normal during their first night of polysomnographic sleep evaluation. FNE
      reflects the adaptive increase of alertness and perhaps the stress resulting from
      an unfamiliar sleeping environment. This effect is usually absent in patients
      with chronic schizophrenia. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine), the
      hormone secreted by the pineal gland at night, has been found to improve sleep in
      elderly patients with insomnia and recently in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia. The authors used FNE as a marker to explore the neurobehavioral
      responses of patients with chronic schizophrenia to melatonin treatment. In a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, 14 patients with chronic schizophrenia
      were administered melatonin (2 mg in a controlled-release formulation) or placebo
      for 3 weeks with a 1-week washout between treatment periods. Polysomnography was 
      performed during the last two consecutive nights of each treatment period. The
      following significant FNEs were observed with melatonin treatment: (1) rapid eye 
      movement sleep latency was longer; (2) sleep efficiency was lower; and (3) the
      duration of wakefulness during sleep was lower on the first night than on the
      second night. These effects were not found when the patients received a placebo. 
      The FNE was manifested regardless of whether melatonin was administered before or
      after the placebo treatment period. For the first time, these results show that
      melatonin treatment exaggerates FNE in patients with chronic schizophrenia,
      thereby suggesting an improved ability of these patients to mobilize alertness in
      unfamiliar surroundings.

TI  - Etanercept in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis: a randomised
      trial.
PG  - 385-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Etanercept, a tumour-necrosis-factor inhibitor, has shown efficacy in
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are
      disease states in which tumour necrosis factor, a proinflammatory cytokine, is
      present in increased concentrations in joints and in the skin. Therefore,
      psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis may be appropriate therapeutic targets for
      etanercept. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 week
      study assessed the efficacy and safety of etanercept (25 mg twice-weekly
      subcutaneous injections) or placebo in 60 patients with psoriatic arthritis and
      psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis endpoints included the proportion of patients who 
      met the Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) and who met the American
      College of Rheumatology preliminary criteria for improvement (ACR20). Psoriasis
      endpoints included improvement in the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI)
      and improvement in prospectively-identified individual target lesions. FINDINGS: 
      In this 12 week study, 26 (87%) of etanercept-treated patients met the PsARC,
      compared with seven (23%) of placebo-controlled patients. The ARC20 was achieved 
      by 22 (73%) of etanercept-treated patients compared with four (13%) of
      placebo-treated patients. Of the 19 patients in each treatment group who could be
      assessed for psoriasis (> or = 3% body surface area), five (26%) of
      etanercept-treated patients achieved a 75% improvement in the PASI, compared with
      none of the placebo-treated patients (p=0.015). The median PASI improvement was
      46% in etanercept-treated patients versus 9% in placebo-treated patients;
      similarly, median target lesion improvements were 50% and 0, respectively.
      Etanercept was well tolerated. INTERPRETATION: Etanercept offers patients with
      psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis a new therapeutic option for control of their
      disease.

TI  - Differential effects of dopamine, dopexamine, and dobutamine on jejunal mucosal
      perfusion early after cardiac surgery.
PG  - 2338-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential differential effects of dopamine,
      dopexamine, and dobutamine on jejunal mucosal perfusion, assessed by endoluminal 
      laser Doppler flowmetry in uncomplicated postcardiac surgical patients. DESIGN: A
      prospective, blinded, randomized, crossover study. SETTING: A cardiothoracic
      intensive care unit in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: A total of ten
      postoperative cardiac surgical patients were studied. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient
      received sequentially, randomly, and in a blinded fashion 2.7+/-0.2 microg x
      kg(-1) x min(-1) dopamine, 0.7+/-0.1 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dopexamine, and
      2.7+/-0.1 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dobutamine. Each inotropic agent was titrated
      to increase cardiac output by 25% from baseline. Data on jejunal mucosal
      perfusion, splanchnic lactate, and oxygen extraction were obtained during a 5-min
      control period and a 5-min drug infusion period after the target cardiac output
      was reached. The procedure was sequentially repeated for each agent, and there
      was a 20- to 30-min washout period between each agent. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
      RESULTS: Dopamine, dopexamine, and dobutamine increased jejunal mucosal perfusion
      by 27% (p < .01), 20% (p < .001), and 7% (p < .001), respectively. The increase
      in jejunal mucosal perfusion by dopamine and dopexamine were significantly more
      pronounced compared with dobutamine (p < .05 and p < .01, respectively), whereas 
      there was no difference between dopamine and dopexamine. Splanchnic oxygen
      extraction decreased to the same extent with all three drugs. Splanchnic lactate 
      extraction did not change for any of the drugs. The effects on central
      hemodynamics were similar for the three inotropic agents. CONCLUSIONS:
      Endoluminal laser Doppler flowmetry is a new tool for the detection of perfusion 
      changes at the local intestinal mucosal level. Dopamine, dopexamine, and
      dobutamine have differential effects on jejunal mucosal perfusion probably
      because of their different receptor stimulating properties. These findings may be
      of clinical importance when the therapeutic goal is to improve gut mucosal
      perfusion.

      physostigmine salicylate, 24 mg/d and 30 mg/d, and daily placebo. Among the
      subjects who completed this phase, 35.9% responded to physostigmine treatment,
      whereas 62.4% were considered nonresponders, and 1.6% could not be evaluated
      because of missing data. After a 4-week placebo-washout phase, 176 responder
      subjects were randomized to receive their best dose of physostigmine or placebo
      in a 12-week double-blind phase. Primary efficacy measures included the cognitive
      subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), the Clinician's 
      Interview-Based Impression of Change With Caregiver Input (CIBIC+), and the
      Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC). RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat
      analysis of the double-blind phase, physostigmine-treated subjects scored -2.02
      points better than placebo-treated subjects on the ADAS-Cog (F1,167 = 6.42 [P =
      .01]) and 0.33 points higher on the CIBIC+ (F1,150 = 5.68 [P = .02]). No
      significant improvement was observed on the CGIC or the secondary outcome
      measures. Nausea and vomiting were experienced by 47.0% of all
      physostigmine-treated subjects during the double-blind phase. CONCLUSIONS:
      Physostigmine demonstrated a statistically significant benefit compared with
      placebo on a clinical global rating of change and an objective test of cognitive 
      function. Given the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects, the role of this 
      agent in clinical use remains to be determined.

TI  - Dual-chamber pacing in the treatment of neurally mediated tilt-positive
      cardioinhibitory syncope : pacemaker versus no therapy: a multicenter randomized 
      study. The Vasovagal Syncope International Study (VASIS) Investigators.
PG  - 294-9
AB  - BACKGROUND-This study was performed to compare implantation of a DDI pacemaker
      with rate hysteresis with no implant in respect to syncopal recurrences in
      patients with severe cardioinhibitory tilt-positive neurally mediated syncope.
      METHODS AND RESULTS-Forty-two patients from 18 European centers were randomized
      to receive a DDI pacemaker programmed to 80 bpm with hysteresis of 45 bpm (19
      patients) or no pacemaker (23 patients). Inclusion criteria were >/=3 syncopes
      over the last 2 years and a positive cardioinhibitory (Vasovagal Syncope
      International Study types 2A and 2B) response to tilt testing. The median number 
      of previous syncopal episodes was 6; asystolic response to tilt testing was
      present in 36 patients (86%) (mean asystole, 13.9+/-10.2 seconds). All patients
      were followed up for a minimum of 1.0 years and a maximum of 6.7 years (mean,
      3.7+/-2.2). One patient (5%) in the pacemaker arm experienced recurrence of
      syncope compared with 14 patients (61%) in the no-pacemaker arm (P=0.0006). In
      the no-pacemaker arm, the median time to first syncopal recurrence was 5 months, 
      with a rate of 0.44 per year. On repeated tilt testing performed within 15 days
      after enrollment, positive responses were observed in 59% of patients with
      pacemakers and in 61% of patients without pacemakers (P=NS). CONCLUSIONS-In a
      limited, select group of patients with tilt-positive cardioinhibitory syncope,
      DDI pacing with hysteresis reduced the likelihood of syncope. The benefit of the 
      therapy was maintained over the long term. Even in untreated patients, the
      syncopal recurrence burden was low. A negative result of tilt testing was not a
      useful means to evaluate therapy efficacy.

TI  - Effects of continuous positive airway pressure on cardiovascular outcomes in
      heart failure patients with and without Cheyne-Stokes respiration.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves cardiac function 
      in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) who also have Cheyne-Stokes
      respiration and central sleep apnea (CSR-CSA). However, the effects of CPAP in
      CHF patients without CSR-CSA have not been tested, and the long-term effects of
      this treatment on clinical cardiovascular outcomes are unknown. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in which 66 patients with
      CHF (29 with and 37 without CSR-CSA) were randomized to either a group that
      received CPAP nightly or to a control group. Change in left ventricular ejection 
      fraction (LVEF) from baseline to 3 months and the combined mortality-cardiac
      transplantation rate over the median 2.2-year follow-up period were compared
      between the CPAP-treated and control groups. For the entire group of patients,
      CPAP had no significant effect on LVEF, but it was associated with a 60% relative
      risk reduction (95% confidence interval, 2% to 64%) in mortality-cardiac
      transplantation rate in patients who complied with CPAP therapy. Stratified
      analysis of patients with and without CSR-CSA revealed that those with CSR-CSA
      experienced both a significant improvement in LVEF at 3 months and a relative
      risk reduction of 81% (95% confidence interval, 26% to 95%) in the
      mortality-cardiac transplantation rate of those who used CPAP. CPAP had no
      significant effect on either of these outcomes in patients without CSR-CSA.
      CONCLUSIONS: CPAP improves cardiac function in CHF patients with CSR-CSA but not 
      in those without it. Although not definitive, our findings also suggest that CPAP
      can reduce the combined mortality-cardiac transplantation rate in those CHF
      patients with CSR-CSA who comply with therapy.

TI  - Enduring effects of nurse home visitation on maternal life course: a 3-year
      follow-up of a randomized trial.
PG  - 1983-9
AB  - CONTEXT: A home visitation program using nurses to improve maternal and child
      outcomes had favorable results in a randomized trial with a primarily white,
      semirural population. Many of the short-term findings have been replicated with
      urban blacks, but whether the program will continue to demonstrate effectiveness 
      after its conclusion is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a
      prenatal and infancy home visitation program on the maternal life course of women
      in an urban environment 3 years after the program ended. DESIGN AND SETTING:
      Three-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of women seen consecutively
      between June 1990 and August 1991 at an obstetrical clinic in Memphis, Tenn, who 
      were enrolled in a visitation program for 2 years after the birth of their first 
      child. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 743 women who were primarily black, were
      pregnant for less than 29 weeks, had no previous live births, and had at least 2 
      sociodemographic risk factors (unmarried, <12 years of education, or unemployed).
      INTERVENTION: An average of 7 (range, 0-18) home visits during pregnancy and 26
      (range, 0-71) from birth to the child's second birthday. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Rate of subsequent pregnancy, mean interval between first and second birth, and
      mean number of months of welfare use. RESULTS: Compared with the control group,
      women who received home visits by nurses had fewer subsequent pregnancies (1.15
      vs 1.34; P=.03), fewer closely spaced subsequent pregnancies (0.22 vs 0.32;
      P=.03), longer intervals between the birth of the first and second child (30.25
      vs 26.60 months; P=.004), and fewer months of using Aid to Families with
      Dependent Children (32.55 vs 36.19; P=.01) and food stamps (41.57 vs 45.04;
      P=.005). Compared with the effect of the program while the program was in
      operation, the effect after it ended was essentially equal for Aid to Families
      with Dependent Children, greater for food stamps, greater for rates of closely
      spaced subsequent pregnancies, and smaller for rates of subsequent pregnancy
      overall. CONCLUSIONS: We found enduring effects of a home visitation program on
      the lives of black women living in an urban setting. While these results were
      smaller in magnitude than those achieved in a previous trial with white women
      living in a semirural setting, the direction of the effects was consistent across
      the 2 studies.

TI  - A comparison of the effects of computer and manual reminders on compliance with a
      mental health clinical practice guideline.
PG  - 196-203
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of computer and manual reminder
      systems on the implementation of a clinical practice guideline. DESIGN:
      Seventy-eight outpatients in a mental health clinic were randomly assigned within
      clinician to one of the two reminder systems. The computer system, called
      CaseWalker, reminded clinicians when guideline-recommended screening for mood
      disorder was due, ensured the fidelity of the diagnosis of major depressive
      disorder to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), and generated a progress note. The manual system
      was a checklist inserted in the paper medical record. MEASURES: Screening rates
      for mood disorder and the completeness of the documentation of which DSM-IV
      criteria were met by patients who were said to have major depressive disorder
      were compared. RESULTS: The CaseWalker, compared with the paper checklist,
      resulted in a higher screening rate for mood disorder (86.5 vs. 61 percent, P =
      0.008) and a higher rate of complete documentation of DSM-IV criteria (100 vs.
      5.6 percent, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In an outpatient mental health clinic,
      computer reminders were shown to be superior to manual reminders in improving
      adherence to a clinical practice guideline for depression.

TI  - Determination of who may derive most benefit from aspirin in primary prevention: 
      subgroup results from a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 13-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine which groups of patients may derive particular benefit or
      experience harm from the use of low dose aspirin for the primary prevention of
      coronary heart disease. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 108 group
      practices in the Medical Research Council's general practice research framework
      who were taking part in the thrombosis prevention trial. PARTICIPANTS: 5499 men
      aged between 45 and 69 years at entry who were at increased risk of coronary
      heart disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Myocardial infarction, coronary death, and 
      stroke. RESULTS: Aspirin reduced coronary events by 20%. This benefit, mainly for
      non-fatal events, was significantly greater the lower the systolic blood pressure
      at entry (interaction P=0.0015), the relative risk at pressures 130 mm Hg being
      0.55 compared with 0.94 at pressures >145 mm Hg. Aspirin also reduced strokes at 
      low but not high pressures, the relative risks being 0.41 and 1.42 (P=0.006)
      respectively. The relative risk of all major cardiovascular events-that is, the
      sum of coronary heart disease and stroke-was 0.59 at pressures <130 mm Hg
      compared with 1.08 at pressures >145 mm Hg (P=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Even with the 
      limitations of subgroup analyses the evidence suggests that the benefit of low
      dose aspirin in primary prevention may occur mainly in those with lower systolic 
      blood pressures, although it is not clear even in these men that the benefit
      outweighs the potential hazards. Men with higher pressures may be exposed to the 
      risks of bleeding while deriving no benefit through reductions in coronary heart 
      disease and stroke.

TI  - Randomized trial of neoadjuvant cisplatin, vincristine, bleomycin, and radical
      hysterectomy versus radiation therapy for bulky stage IB and IIA cervical cancer.
PG  - 1740-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by
      radical hysterectomy with that of radiotherapy (R/T) for bulky early-stage
      cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with previously untreated bulky
      (primary tumor >/= 4 cm) stage IB or IIA non-small-cell carcinoma of the uterine 
      cervix were randomly assigned to receive either cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) and
      vincristine 1 mg/m(2) for 1 day and bleomycin 25 mg/m(2) for 3 days for three
      cycles followed by radical hysterectomy (NAC arm) or receive primary pelvic
      radiotherapy only (R/T arm). The ratio of patient allocation was 6:4 for the NAC 
      and R/T arms. Women with enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes on image study were
      ineligible unless results of cytologic or histologic studies were negative.
      RESULTS: Of the 124 eligible patients, 68 in the NAC arm and 52 in the R/T arm
      could be evaluated. The median duration of follow-up was 39 months. Thirty-one
      percent of patients in the NAC arm and 27% in the R/T arm had relapse or
      persistent diseases after treatment, and 21% in each group died of disease.
      Estimated cumulative survival rates at 2 years were 81% for the NAC arm and 84%
      for the R/T arm; the 5-year rates were 70% and 61%, respectively. There were no
      significant differences in disease-free survival and overall survival.
      CONCLUSION: NAC followed by radical hysterectomy and primary R/T showed similar
      efficacy for bulky stage IB or IIA cervical cancer. Further study to identify
      patient subgroups better suited for either treatment modality and to evaluate the
      concurrent use of cisplatin and radiation without routine hysterectomy is
      necessary.

TI  - Displaced tibial shaft fractures: a prospective randomized study of closed
      intramedullary nailing versus cast treatment in 53 patients.
PG  - 160-7
AB  - Of 53 patients with unilateral, displaced and closed or grade 1 open tibial shaft
      fractures, 27 patients (group I) were randomized to treatment with an
      intramedullary nail and 26 patients (group II) to treatment with a plaster cast. 
      12 fractures in the latter group were considered stable enough for treatment with
      only a cast (group IIa), while 14 fractures in group II showed redisplacement
      during reduction under anesthesia or at 1 week follow-up. Therefore, these
      fractures were stabilized with cerclage or screws (group IIb), which was a
      prerequisite for continuing cast treatment. The mean time-to-union was 19 weeks
      for group I, and 25 weeks for group II. 6 patients in group I and 16 in group II 
      had delayed union. The Nottingham Health Profile index scores on physical
      mobility, social isolation, work ability, and sexual life were significantly
      better in group I than in group II at 3 months after injury. Delayed union,
      malunion, and restricted range of motion at the ankle joint were common
      complications when these fractures were treated with a cast. We recommend
      intramedullary nailing for these fractures.

TI  - First-night effect of melatonin treatment in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 691-4
AB  - The first-night effect (FNE) is the tendency for individuals to sleep worse than 
      normal during their first night of polysomnographic sleep evaluation. FNE
      reflects the adaptive increase of alertness and perhaps the stress resulting from
      an unfamiliar sleeping environment. This effect is usually absent in patients
      with chronic schizophrenia. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine), the
      hormone secreted by the pineal gland at night, has been found to improve sleep in
      elderly patients with insomnia and recently in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia. The authors used FNE as a marker to explore the neurobehavioral
      responses of patients with chronic schizophrenia to melatonin treatment. In a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, 14 patients with chronic schizophrenia
      were administered melatonin (2 mg in a controlled-release formulation) or placebo
      for 3 weeks with a 1-week washout between treatment periods. Polysomnography was 
      performed during the last two consecutive nights of each treatment period. The
      following significant FNEs were observed with melatonin treatment: (1) rapid eye 
      movement sleep latency was longer; (2) sleep efficiency was lower; and (3) the
      duration of wakefulness during sleep was lower on the first night than on the
      second night. These effects were not found when the patients received a placebo. 
      The FNE was manifested regardless of whether melatonin was administered before or
      after the placebo treatment period. For the first time, these results show that
      melatonin treatment exaggerates FNE in patients with chronic schizophrenia,
      thereby suggesting an improved ability of these patients to mobilize alertness in
      unfamiliar surroundings.

      trial. BOTOX Study Group.
PG  - 108-15
AB  - Increased gastrocnemius/soleus muscle tone in children with cerebral palsy may
      cause an equinus of the ankle. Botulinum toxin type A (BTX), a neuromuscular
      blocking agent, reduces muscle tone in various neuromuscular disorders. The
      safety and short-term efficacy of BTX injections were evaluated in a prospective,
      3-month, double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 114 children with
      cerebral palsy and dynamic equinus foot deformity. Outcome was determined by
      observational gait analysis, ankle range-of-motion measurements, and
      quantification of muscle denervation by nerve conduction. Patients in the BTX
      group demonstrated improved gait function and partial denervation of the injected
      muscle. No serious adverse events were reported.

TI  - Percutaneous tracheostomy in critically ill patients: a prospective, randomized
      comparison of two techniques.
PG  - 3734-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively compare two commonly used methods for percutaneous
      dilational tracheostomy (PDT) in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Prospective,
      randomized, clinical trial. SETTING: Trauma and general intensive care units of a
      university tertiary teaching hospital, which is also a level 1 trauma center.
      PATIENTS: One hundred critically ill patients with an indication for PDT.
      INTERVENTIONS: PDT with the Ciaglia technique using the Ciaglia PDT introducer
      set and the Griggs technique using a Griggs PDT kit and guidewire dilating
      forceps. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Surgical time, difficulties, and surgical
      and anesthesia complications were measured at 0-2 hrs, 24 hrs, and 7 days
      postprocedure. Groups were well matched, and there were no differences between
      the two methods in surgical time or in anesthesia complications. Major bleeding
      complications were 4.4 times more frequent with the Griggs PDT kit. With the
      Ciaglia PDT kit, both intraoperative and at 2 and 24 hrs, surgical complications 
      were less common (p = .023) and the procedure was more often completed without
      expert assistance (p = .013). Tracheostomy bleeding was not associated with
      either anticoagulant therapy or an abnormal clotting profile. Multivariate
      analysis identified the predictors of PDT complications as the Griggs PDT kit (p 
      = .027) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score 
      (p = .041). The significant predictors of time required to complete PDT were the 
      APACHE II score (p = .041), a less experienced operator (p = .0001), and a female
      patient (p = .013). CONCLUSIONS: Patients experiencing PDT with the Ciaglia PDT
      kit had a lower surgical complication rate (2% vs. 25%), less operative and
      postoperative bleeding, and less overall technical difficulties than did patients
      undergoing PDT with the Griggs PDT kit. Ciaglia PDT is, therefore, the preferred 
      technique for percutaneous tracheostomy in critically ill patients.

      anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastric ulcers: results of a double-blind,
      randomized, multicenter study. NSAID-Associated Gastric Ulcer Study Group.
PG  - 1455-61
AB  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is
      limited by adverse gastrointestinal tract events. OBJECTIVE: To identify the
      optimal antisecretory therapy for healing of gastric ulcer in patients using
      NSAIDs and the impact of concurrent Helicobacter pylori infection on ulcer
      healing. DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group study.
      SETTING: Gastroenterology practices in ambulatory and referral center settings.
      PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-three patients with an active, nonmalignant gastric
      ulcer at least 5 mm in diameter confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy and who
      continued to receive stable doses of NSAIDs. INTERVENTION: Patients were
      randomized to receive ranitidine hydrochloride, 150 mg twice daily, or
      lansoprazole, 15 mg or 30 mg once daily, for 8 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Healing was
      assessed by endoscopy at 4 and 8 weeks in an intent-to-treat population.
      Helicobacter pylori status was assessed by histological examination. RESULTS:
      After 8 weeks of treatment, healing was observed in 61 (53%) of 115, 81 (69%) of 
      118, and 85 (73%) of 117 patients receiving ranitidine lansoprazole, 15 mg, and
      lansoprazole, 30 mg, respectively (P<.05 for ranitidine vs both lansoprazole
      doses; 95% confidence interval, 3.2-28.0 for ranitidine vs lansoprazole, 15 mg,
      and 7.4-31.8 for ranitidine vs lansoprazole, 30 mg). The gastric ulcer healing
      rates were similar between H pylori-infected and -noninfected patients, with a
      statistically significant increase with the use of lansoprazole vs ranitidine.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients who require continuous treatment with NSAIDs,
      lansoprazole is superior to ranitidine for healing of NSAID-associated gastric
      ulcers. Healing is not delayed by the presence of H pylori infection.

TI  - Cholesterol reduction improves myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients
      with coronary artery disease and average cholesterol levels.
PG  - 76-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate whether pravastatin treatment increases
      myocardial perfusion, as assessed by thallium-201 single-photon emission computed
      tomographic (SPECT) dipyridamole testing, in patients with coronary artery
      disease (CAD) and average cholesterol levels. BACKGROUND: Previous studies in
      hypercholesterolemic patients have demonstrated that cholesterol reduction
      restores peripheral and coronary endothelium-dependent vasodilation and increases
      myocardial perfusion. METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled study
      with a cross-over design. Twenty patients with CAD were randomly assigned to
      receive 20 mg of pravastatin or placebo for 16 weeks and then were crossed over
      to the opposite medication for a further 16 weeks. Lipid and lipoprotein analysis
      and dipyridamole thallium-201 SPECT were performed at the end of each period. The
      SPECT images were visually analyzed in eight myocardial segments using a 4-point 
      scoring system by two independent observers. A summed stress score and a summed
      rest score were obtained for each patient. Quantitative evaluation was performed 
      by the Cedars-Sinai method. The magnitude of the defect was expressed as a
      percentage of global myocardial perfusion. RESULTS: Total and low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels during placebo were 214 +/- 29 mg/dl and 148 +/-
      25 mg/dl, respectively. These levels with pravastatin were 170 +/- 23 mg/dl and
      103 +/- 23 mg/dl, respectively. The summed stress score and summed rest score
      were lower with pravastatin than with placebo (7.2 +/- 2.3 vs. 5.9 +/- 2.3, p =
      0.012 and 3.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 2.4 +/- 2.2, p = 0.043, respectively). Quantitative
      analysis showed a smaller perfusion defect with pravastatin (29.2%) as compared
      with placebo (33.8%) (p = 0.021) during dipyridamole stress. No differences were 
      found at rest. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing cholesterol levels with pravastatin in
      patients with CAD improves myocardial perfusion during dipyridamole stress
      thallium-201 SPECT.

      DESIGN: We prospectively enrolled healthy patients with infected ingrown
      toenails. Each patient was randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups that received
      either 1 week of antibiotics and a chemical matrixectomy simultaneously (group
      1), antibiotics for 1 week and then a matrixectomy (group 2), or a matrixectomy
      alone (group 3). SETTING: Institutional ambulatory outpatient clinic. PATIENTS:
      Fifty-four healthy patients with infected ingrown toenails were studied. Patients
      with immunocompromised states, peripheral vascular disease, or cellulitis
      proximal to the hallux interphalangeal joint were excluded. Groups were age
      matched for comparison. RESULTS: Mean healing times for groups 1, 2, and 3 were
      1.9, 2.3, and 2.0 weeks, respectively. Subjects receiving antibiotics and a
      simultaneous chemical matrixectomy (group 1) healed significantly sooner than
      those receiving a 1-week course of antibiotics followed by a matrixectomy (group 
      2). There was not a significant difference in healing time between those that
      received a chemical matrixectomy alone (group 3) and those that received a
      matrixectomy coupled with a course of oral antibiotics (group 1). CONCLUSION: The
      use of oral antibiotics as an adjunctive therapy in treating ingrown toenails
      does not play a role in decreasing the healing time or postprocedure morbidity.

TI  - Gabapentin effect on spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a placebo-controlled,
      randomized trial.
PG  - 164-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of gabapentin on subject self-report and
      physician-administered spasticity scales in individuals with multiple sclerosis. 
      DESIGN: Prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover design.
      SETTING: The Multiple Sclerosis Center at the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical
      Center. INTERVENTION: Subjects were titrated to either 900 mg gabapentin orally
      three times a day or placebo over a 6-day period. Subjects underwent a 14-day
      washout and then were crossed over. No other changes were made to their
      medication regimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were divided into
      two categories: subject self-report scales physician-administered scales. Subject
      self-report scales included the spasm frequency scale, spasm severity scale,
      interference with function scale, painful spasm scale, and global assessment
      scale. Physician-administered scales included the Modified Ashworth Scale, clonus
      scale, deep tendon reflexes, plantar stimulation response, and the Kurtzke
      Expanded Disability Status (EDSS) Scale. Digit Span and Digit Symbol subtests of 
      the WAIS-R Intelligence Scale were administered to assess for possible impaired
      concentration. The Fatigue Impact Scale was administered to assess for changes in
      fatigue. The adjective generation technique was administered to assess for
      alterations in mood. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in the
      impairment of spasticity was found in the gabapentin-treated subjects compared
      with placebo as measured by the self-report scales of the spasm severity scale,
      interference with function scale, painful spasm scale, and global assessment
      scale and by the physician-administered scales of the Modified Ashworth and
      plantar stimulation response. No significant difference was noted in the Digit
      Span, Digit Symbol, adjective generation technique, and EDSS. CONCLUSION:
      Gabapentin reduces the impairment of spasticity, compared with placebo, without
      the side effects of worsening concentration and fatigue.

TI  - Zafirlukast improves asthma control in patients receiving high-dose inhaled
      corticosteroids.
PG  - 578-85
AB  - Not all asthma can be adequately controlled, despite the use of high-dose inhaled
      corticosteroids. Because cysteinyl-leukotrienes (Cys-LT) have been implicated in 
      the pathogenesis of asthma, we hypothesized that the leukotriene receptor
      antagonist zafirlukast, in combination with high-doses of inhaled
      corticosteroids, might be efficacious in severe asthma. In a double-blind,
      parallel group study, 368 chronic adult asthmatic patients treated with inhaled
      corticosteroids (1,000 to 4,000 microgram/d), who had a predefined level of
      asthma symptoms during the run in period of the study, were randomly assigned to 
      receive additional treatment with a high dose of zafirlukast (80 mg twice daily) 
      (n = 180) or placebo (n = 188) for 6 wk. Compared with placebo, zafirlukast
      produced a significant improvement over baseline in the primary study endpoint of
      mean morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) (18.7 L/min versus 1.5 L/min, p <
      0.001), as well as in evening PEFR (p < 0.01), FEV(1) (p < 0.05), daytime symptom
      score (p < 0.001), and beta(2)-agonist use (p < 0.001). Furthermore, zafirlukast 
      significantly reduced the risk of an exacerbation of asthma (odds ratio [OR]:
      0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38 to 0.99) and the risk of patients
      requiring a further increase in asthma controller therapy (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2
      to 0.8). In conclusion, in patients taking high-dose inhaled corticosteroids,
      zafirlukast improves pulmonary function and asthma symptoms, and reduces the risk
      of an asthma exacerbation, suggesting that the contribution of leukotrienes to
      asthma symptoms and exacerbations is not adequately controlled by high-dose
      inhaled corticosteroids.

TI  - Effect of breastfeeding and formula feeding on transmission of HIV-1: a
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 1167-74
AB  - CONTEXT: Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is known to 
      occur through breastfeeding, but the magnitude of risk has not been precisely
      defined. Whether breast milk HIV-1 transmission risk exceeds the potential risk
      of formula-associated diarrheal mortality in developing countries is unknown.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of breast milk transmission of HIV-1 and
      to compare mortality rates and HIV-1-free survival in breastfed and formula-fed
      infants. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized clinical trial conducted from November
      1992 to July 1998 in antenatal clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, with a median follow-up
      period of 24 months. PARTICIPANTS: Of 425 HIV-1-seropositive,
      antiretroviral-naive pregnant women enrolled, 401 mother-infant pairs were
      included in the analysis of trial end points. INTERVENTIONS: Mother-infant pairs 
      were randomized to breastfeeding (n = 212) vs formula feeding arms (n = 213).
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Infant HIV-1 infection and death during the first 2 years 
      of life, compared between the 2 intervention groups. RESULTS: Compliance with the
      assigned feeding modality was 96% in the breastfeeding arm and 70% in the formula
      arm (P<.001). Median duration of breastfeeding was 17 months. Of the 401 infants 
      included in the analysis, 94% were followed up to HIV-1 infection or mortality
      end points: 83% for the HIV-1 infection end point and 93% to the mortality end
      point. The cumulative probability of HIV-1 infection at 24 months was 36.7% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 29.4%-44.0%) in the breastfeeding arm and 20.5% (95%
      CI, 14.0%-27.0%) in the formula arm (P = .001). The estimated rate of breast milk
      transmission was 16.2% (95% CI, 6.5%-25.9%). Forty-four percent of HIV-1
      infection in the breastfeeding arm was attributable to breast milk. Most breast
      milk transmission occurred early, with 75% of the risk difference between the 2
      arms occurring by 6 months, although transmission continued throughout the
      duration of exposure. The 2-year mortality rates in both arms were similar
      (breastfeeding arm, 24.4% [95% CI, 18.2%-30.7%] vs formula feeding arm, 20.0%
      [95% CI, 14.4%-25.6%]; P = .30). The rate of HIV-1-free survival at 2 years was
      significantly lower in the breastfeeding arm than in the formula feeding arm
      (58.0% vs 70.0%, respectively; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of breast
      milk transmission of HIV-1 was 16.2% in this randomized clinical trial, and the
      majority of infections occurred early during breastfeeding. The use of breast
      milk substitutes prevented 44% of infant infections and was associated with
      significantly improved HIV-1-free survival.

TI  - Immediate and long term effects of weight reduction in obese people with asthma: 
      randomised controlled study.
PG  - 827-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of weight reduction on obese patients
      with asthma. DESIGN: Open study, two randomised parallel groups. SETTING: Private
      outpatients centre, Helsinki, Finland. PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of 19 obese
      patients with asthma (body mass index (kg/m(2)) 30 to 42) recruited through
      newspaper advertisements. INTERVENTION: Supervised weight reduction programme
      including 8 week very low energy diet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body weight,
      morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
      expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)); and also asthma symptoms, number of
      acute episodes, courses of oral steroids, health status (quality of life).
      RESULTS: At the end of the weight reducing programme, the participants in the
      treatment group had lost a mean of 14.5% of their pretreatment weight, the
      controls 0.3%. The corresponding figures after one year were 11.3% and a weight
      gain of 2.2%. After the 8 week dieting period the difference in changes in
      percentage of predicted FEV(1) from baseline in the treatment and control groups 
      was 7.2% (95% confidence interval 1.9% to 12.5%, P=0. 009). The corresponding
      difference in the changes in FVC was 8.6% (4. 8% to 12.5%, P<0.0001). After one
      year the differences in the changes in the two groups were still significant:
      7.6% for FEV(1) (1. 5% to 13.8%, P=0.02) and 7.6% for FVC (3.5% to 11.8%,
      P=0.001). By the end of the weight reduction programme, reduction in dyspnoea was
      13 mm (on a visual analogue scale 0 mm to 100 mm) in the treatment group and 1 mm
      in the control group (P=0.02). The reduction of rescue medication was 1.2 and 0.1
      doses respectively (P=0.03). After one year the differences in the changes
      between the two groups were -12 for symptom scores (range -1 to -22, P=0.04) and 
      -10 for total scores (-18 to -1, P=0.02). The median number of exacerbations in
      the treatment group was 1 (0-4) and in the controls 4 (0-7), P=0.001. CONCLUSION:
      Weight reduction in obese patients with asthma improves lung function, symptoms, 
      morbidity, and health status.

TI  - Statistical methods to improve the precision of the treadmill exercise test.
PG  - 1274-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study systematically compared different measures of ST segment
      depression from the treadmill exercise test. BACKGROUND: The value of the
      treadmill exercise test for objectively measuring treatment effects is limited by
      random error in the measurement of ST depression and may be biased by regression 
      to the mean or by the decision to terminate the test. METHODS: Treadmill exercise
      was performed in 21 subjects with ischemic heart disease 1 h after isosorbide
      dinitrate 10 mg or placebo in a double-blind randomized crossover study. A
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded every 30 s during and at peak
      exercise. The relative sample size needed to detect the nitrate effect was
      compared for different summary measures of ST depression. RESULTS: The ST
      depression measured from a single unmatched lead at longest equivalent
      sub-maximal exercise needed the lowest sample size to detect the nitrate effect
      in paired comparisons (p = 0.000006). Averaging over multiple leads or times did 
      not improve detection of the nitrate effect. The rate of increase in ST
      depression (in mm/min) calculated by linear regression needed a similar sample
      size (x1.32, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.58). A larger sample size was needed for ST
      depression at peak exercise (x2.9, CI 1.3, 11.1) and exercise duration (x4.5, CI 
      1.5, 38). Time to 1-mm ST depression was the least efficient measurement
      (relative sample size x15.5, CI 1.6, >1,000). Comparison of matched leads
      resulted in >2-fold differences in estimates of the nitrate effect because of
      bias from regression to the mean. CONCLUSIONS: Maximal ST depression at longest
      equivalent sub-maximal exercise and the maximal rate of increase in ST depression
      had less bias and random variation than did other commonly used measures. The
      rate of increase in ST depression is preferred because it can be calculated in
      either paired or unpaired studies.

TI  - Low molecular-weight heparin versus aspirin in patients with acute ischaemic
      stroke and atrial fibrillation: a double-blind randomised study. HAEST Study
      Group. Heparin in Acute Embolic Stroke Trial.
PG  - 1205-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation have an 
      increased risk of early stroke recurrence, and anticoagulant treatment with
      heparins has been widely advocated, despite missing data on the balance of risk
      and benefit. METHODS: Heparin in Acute Embolic Stroke Trial (HAEST) was a
      multicentre, randomised, double-blind, and double-dummy trial on the effect of
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH, dalteparin 100 IU/kg subcutaneously twice a
      day) or aspirin (160 mg every day) for the treatment of 449 patients with acute
      ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary aim was to test whether
      treatment with LMWH, started within 30 h of stroke onset, is superior to aspirin 
      for the prevention of recurrent stroke during the first 14 days. FINDINGS: The
      frequency of recurrent ischaemic stroke during the first 14 days was 19/244
      (8.5%) in dalteparin-allocated patients versus 17/225 (7.5%) in aspirin-allocated
      patients (odds ratio=1.13, 95% CI 0.57-2.24). The secondary events during the
      first 14 days also revealed no benefit of dalteparin compared with aspirin:
      symptomatic cerebral haemorrhage 6/224 versus 4/225; symptomatic and asymptomatic
      cerebral haemorrhage 26/224 versus 32/225; progression of symptoms within the
      first 48 hours 24/224 versus 17/225; and death 21/224 versus 16/225. There were
      no significant differences in functional outcome or death at 14 days or 3 months.
      INTERPRETATION: The present data do not provide any evidence that LMWH is
      superior to aspirin for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation. However, the study could not exclude the possibility of
      smaller, but still worthwhile, effects of either of the trial drugs.

TI  - Coordination of primary health care for back pain. A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 251-8; discussion 258-9
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial comparing usual care with a program
      for the coordination of primary health care (CORE) for the treatment of subacute 
      low-back pain patients. OBJECTIVES: To measure the effectiveness of the CORE
      program as a mean for implementing clinical practice guidelines for low-back pain
      in an urban community. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Clinical practice guidelines
      have been developed for primary care physicians and patients on the clinical
      management of low-back pain. The implementation of the guidelines in a large
      community is difficult with the multiplicity of medical and nonmedical back care 
      providers and products. The CORE program was designed to make the guidelines fit 
      in this complex environment. METHODS: One hundred ten workers compensated for
      low-back pain for 4 to 8 weeks in metropolitan Montreal were randomized in two
      groups: usual care (N = 56) and the CORE program (N = 54). Coordination of
      primary health care was performed by two primary care physicians and a nurse in
      liaison with the treating physicians, and included a complete examination,
      recommendations for the clinical management, and support to carry out the
      recommendations. All workers were followed for 6 months. Back pain and functional
      status were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. RESULTS: In the 6-month
      follow-up, the CORE group returned to work 6.6 days (standard error = 8.9)
      quicker than the control group, a difference that was not statistically
      significant. However, the CORE group showed a sustained improvement in pain and
      functional status with two-fold differences at the end of the 6 months of
      follow-up. This represented nine points on the Oswestry scale (P = 0.02) and 12
      points on the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (P = 0.01). The CORE group also
      used three times less specialized imaging tests of the spine at 3 months (P <
      0.01) and exercised twice as much at 6 months (P < 0.05) than the controls.
      CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic results for workers with low-back pain could be
      improved by implementing the clinical practice guidelines with primary care
      physicians in a large community, without delaying the return to work. The CORE
      intervention for back pain patients is highly relevant to primary care practice. 
      It is simple in its application, flexible to accommodate physicians' and-
      patients' preferences in health care, and it is effective on patients' clinical
      outcome.

TI  - A randomized, controlled, phase II trial comparing escalating doses of
      subcutaneous interleukin-2 plus antiretrovirals versus antiretrovirals alone in
      human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts >/=350/mm3.
PG  - 1614-21
AB  - A total of 73 patients with baseline CD4+ cell counts >/=350 cells/mm3 who were
      receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) were randomized to receive
      subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2; n=36) in addition to ART or to continue ART
      alone (n=37). Subcutaneous IL-2 was delivered at 1 of 3 doses (1.5 million
      international units inverted question markMIU, 4.5 MIU, and 7.5 MIU per dose) by 
      twice-daily injection for 5 consecutive days every 8 weeks. After 24 weeks, the
      time-weighted mean change from baseline CD4+ cell count was 210 cells/mm3 for
      recipients of subcutaneous IL-2, compared with 29 cells/mm3 for recipients of ART
      alone (P<.001). There were no significant differences between treatment groups
      for measures of plasma human immunodeficiency virus RNA (P=.851). Subcutaneous
      IL-2 delivered at doses of 4.5 MIU and 7.5 MIU resulted in significant increases 
      in CD4+ cell count (P=.006 and P<.001, respectively), compared with that seen in 
      control patients. These changes were not significant in the 1.5 MIU dose group
      compared with that in the control patients (P=.105). Side effects that occurred
      from subcutaneous IL-2 administration were generally low grade, of short
      duration, and readily managed in an outpatient environment.

TI  - Baby CareLink: using the internet and telemedicine to improve care for high-risk 
      infants.
PG  - 1318-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an Internet-based telemedicine program designed to reduce 
      the costs of care, to provide enhanced medical, informational, and emotional
      support to families of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants during and after
      their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay. BACKGROUND: Baby CareLink is a
      multifaceted telemedicine program that incorporates videoconferencing and World
      Wide Web (WWW) technologies to enhance interactions between families, staff, and 
      community providers. The videoconferencing module allows virtual visits and
      distance learning from a family's home during an infant's hospitalization as well
      as virtual house calls and remote monitoring after discharge. Baby CareLink's WWW
      site contains information on issues that confront these families. In addition,
      its security architecture allows efficient and confidential sharing of
      patient-based data and communications among authorized hospital and community
      users. DESIGN/METHODS: A randomized trial of Baby CareLink was conducted in a
      cohort of VLBW infants born between November 1997 and April 1999. Eligible
      infants were randomized within 10 days of birth. Families of intervention group
      infants were given access to the Baby CareLink telemedicine application. A
      multimedia computer with WWW browser and videoconferencing equipment was
      installed in their home within 3 weeks of birth. The control group received care 
      as usually practiced in this NICU. Quality of care was assessed using a
      standardized family satisfaction survey administered after discharge. In
      addition, the effect of Baby CareLink on hospital length of stay as well as
      family visitation and interactions with infant and staff were measured. RESULTS: 
      Of the 176 VLBW infants admitted during the study period, 30 control and 26 study
      patients were enrolled. The groups were similar in patient and family
      characteristics as well as rates of inpatient morbidity. The CareLink group
      reported higher overall quality of care. Families in the CareLink group reported 
      significantly fewer problems with the overall quality of care received by their
      family (mean problem score: 3% vs 13%). In addition, CareLink families also
      reported greater satisfaction with the unit's physical environment and visitation
      policies (mean problem score: 13% vs 50%). The frequency of family visits,
      telephone calls to the NICU, and holding of the infant did not differ between
      groups. The duration of hospitalization until ultimate discharge home was similar
      in the 2 groups (68.5 +/- 28.3 vs 70.6 +/- 35.6 days). Among infants born
      weighing <1000 g (n = 31) there was a tendency toward shorter lengths of stay
      (77.4 +/- 26.2 vs 93.1 +/- 35.6 days). All infants in the CareLink group were
      discharged directly to home whereas 6/30 (20%) of control infants were
      transferred to community hospitals before ultimate discharge home. CONCLUSIONS:
      CareLink significantly improves family satisfaction with inpatient VLBW care and 
      definitively lowers costs associated with hospital to hospital transfer. Our data
      suggest the use of telemedicine and the Internet support the educational and
      emotional needs of families facilitating earlier discharge to home of VLBW
      infants. We believe that further extension of the Baby CareLink model to the
      postdischarge period will significantly improve the coordination and efficiency
      of care.

PG  - 1734-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of roquinimex (linomide) in the
      management of relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS as monitored by
      MRI. BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies and several short term randomized trials of 
      linomide suggested clinical and MRI-measured benefits with acceptable risk for
      closely followed MS patients. METHODS: The North American Linomide Trial formally
      screened 853 individuals for relapsing or secondary progressive, clinically
      definite MS; recent disease activity or progression; and an Expanded Disability
      Status Scale score at entry of 3.0 to 6.5 inclusive. MRI was obtained on 811
      subjects at pre-enrollment, 718 cases at enrollment, and then at three monthly
      intervals until the trial was prematurely terminated for unacceptable toxicity.
      RESULTS: Enhancement was found on 40.2% of 718 entry scans. Statistically robust 
      correlations were found between clinical demographic data and several entry MRI
      measures including CSF volume, a reflection of brain atrophy. Assessment of the
      effect of treatment on MRI-measured disease was limited by early trial
      termination. However, active treatment for 3 months reduced the proportion of
      patients with one or more enhancements. An exploratory analysis suggested that
      2.5 mg was the most active of three doses tested in limiting the total volume of 
      enhanced tissue, the proportion of MRI-defined lesions designated as "black
      holes," and by a novel MRI composite disease measure. CONCLUSIONS: The short term
      signature of the effect of linomide on MRI-measured aspects of the disease
      suggests that safer drugs of this class might be useful in the management of MS. 
      The use of a composite index of the heterogeneous nature of the pathology of MS
      as captured by MRI may have merit as an outcome measure in clinical trials.

TI  - High-versus low-threshold surfactant retreatment for neonatal respiratory
      distress syndrome.
PG  - 282-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Surfactant therapy has become an effective standard therapy for
      infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The first dose may be given
      either as prophylaxis immediately after delivery, or as rescue after an infant
      has developed RDS. Second and subsequent doses are currently recommended by the
      manufacturers to be administered at minimal levels of respiratory support.
      PURPOSE: This study compared the relative efficacy of administering second and
      subsequent doses of Infasurf surfactant at a low threshold (FIO(2) >30%, still
      requiring endotracheal intubation) versus a high threshold (FIO(2) >40%, mean
      airway pressure >7 cm H(2)O) of respiratory support. METHODS: A total of 2484
      neonates received a first dose of surfactant; 1267 reached conventional
      retreatment criteria and were randomized to be retreated according to low- or
      high-threshold criteria. They were then retreated at a minimum of 6-hour
      intervals each time they reached their assigned threshold until receiving a
      maximum of 4 total doses. Subjects were stratified by whether they received their
      first dose by prophylaxis or rescue and by whether their lung disease was
      considered complicated (evidence of perinatal compromise or sepsis) or
      uncomplicated. RESULTS: Among the patients randomized, 33% of prophylaxis and 23%
      of rescue subjects met criteria for the complicated stratum. Although infants
      allocated to the high-threshold strategy were receiving slightly more oxygen at
      72 hours, there was no difference in the number receiving mechanical ventilation 
      at 72 hours or in the secondary respiratory outcomes (requirement for
      supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation at 28 days, supplemental oxygen at 
      36 weeks' postconceptional age, inspired oxygen concentration >60% at any time). 
      However, there was a significantly higher mortality for infants with complicated 
      RDS who had received retreatment according to the high-threshold strategy.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that equal efficacy can be realized by delaying
      surfactant retreatment of infants with uncomplicated RDS until they have reached 
      a higher level of respiratory support than is the current standard. We speculate 
      that this would result in a substantial cost-saving from less utilization of
      drug. Conversely, we believe that infants with complicated RDS should continue to
      be treated by the low-threshold retreatment strategy, which is currently
      recommended by the manufacturers of the commercially available surfactants.

TI  - Atovaquone and azithromycin for the treatment of babesiosis.
PG  - 1454-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Babesiosis is a tick-borne, malaria-like illness known to be enzootic
      in southern New England. A course of clindamycin and quinine is the standard
      treatment, but this regimen frequently causes adverse reactions and occasionally 
      fails. A promising alternative treatment is atovaquone plus azithromycin.
      METHODS: We conducted a prospective, nonblinded, randomized trial of the two
      regimens in 58 subjects with non-life-threatening babesiosis on Nantucket, on
      Block Island, and in southern Connecticut. The subjects were assigned to receive 
      either atovaquone (750 mg every 12 hours) and azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 and
      250 mg per day thereafter) for seven days (40 subjects) or clindamycin (600 mg
      every 8 hours) and quinine (650 mg every 8 hours) for seven days (18 subjects).
      RESULTS: Adverse effects were reported by 15 percent of the subjects who received
      atovaquone and azithromycin, as compared with 72 percent of those who received
      clindamycin and quinine (P<0.001). The most common adverse effects with
      atovaquone and azithromycin were diarrhea and rash (each in 8 percent of the
      subjects); with clindamycin and quinine the most common adverse effects were
      tinnitus (39 percent), diarrhea (33 percent), and decreased hearing (28 percent).
      Symptoms had resolved three months after the start of therapy in 65 percent of
      those who received atovaquone and azithromycin and 73 percent of those who
      received clindamycin and quinine (P=0.66), and after six months no patient in
      either group had symptoms. Three months after the completion of the assigned
      regimen, no parasites could be seen on microscopy, and no Babesia microti DNA was
      detected in the blood of any subject. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of
      babesiosis, a regimen of atovaquone and azithromycin is as effective as a regimen
      of clindamycin and quinine and is associated with fewer adverse reactions.

TI  - Magnesium sulfate as a vehicle for nebulized salbutamol in acute asthma.
PG  - 193-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Magnesium sulfate is thought to be an effective bronchodilator when
      administered intravenously to patients with acute severe asthma, and it can be
      safely administered via inhalation to patients with stable asthma. Our goal was
      to determine if isotonic magnesium sulfate could be used as a vehicle for
      nebulized salbutamol for patients with acute asthma. METHODS: We enrolled 35
      patients with acute asthma in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. After
      measurement of peak expiratory flow, patients received 2.5 mg salbutamol plus
      either 3 mL normal saline solution (n = 16) or isotonic magnesium sulfate (n =
      19) through a jet nebulizer. Peak flow was reassessed 10 and 20 minutes after
      treatment. RESULTS: Peak flow at baseline was similar in the two groups. Ten
      minutes after baseline, the mean (+/- SD) percentage increase in peak flow was
      greater in the magnesium sulfate-salbutamol group (61% +/- 45%) than in the
      normal saline-salbutamol group (31% +/- 28%; difference = 30%; 95% confidence
      interval [CI] for the difference: 3% to 56%; P = 0.03). At 20 minutes, the
      percentage increase in peak flow was 57% greater in the magnesium sulfate group
      (95% CI: 4% to 110%, P = 0.04). There was a significant inverse correlation
      between baseline peak flow (percent of predicted) and the percentage increase in 
      peak flow at 20 minutes in the magnesium sulfate group (r = -0.82, P <0.0001),
      but not in the saline group (r = -0.12, P = 0.67). CONCLUSION: In patients with
      acute asthma, isotonic magnesium sulfate, as a vehicle for nebulized salbutamol, 
      increased the peak flow response to treatment in comparison with salbutamol plus 
      normal saline.

TI  - A double-blind placebo controlled randomised trial of misoprostol and oxytocin in
      the management of the third stage of labour.
PG  - 1111-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare oral misoprostol 400 microg with intramuscular oxytocin 10 
      IU in the routine management of the third stage. DESIGN: Double-blind placebo
      controlled trial. SETTING: Main referral hospital and its associated polyclinics 
      in Accra, Ghana. POPULATION: Four hundred and one low risk women, in the second
      stage of labour with anticipated vaginal delivery, who entered labour
      spontaneously. METHODS: After delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby, the 
      women were randomised to receive either: 1. misoprostol 400 microg powder in
      water orally and 1 mL normal saline intramuscular injection (placebo); or 2.
      powdered cellulose in water orally (placebo) and 1 mL oxytocin 10 IU
      intramuscular injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in haemoglobin
      concentration from before delivery to 12 hours postpartum. Secondary outcomes
      included need for additional oxytocics, blood loss > 500 mL and > 1,000 mL,
      operative intervention for postpartum haemorrhage, and side effects, including
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, shivering and elevated temperature. RESULTS:
      Demographic characteristics were similar. There was no significant difference in 
      change in haemoglobin concentration between the two groups (0.60 g/dL for
      misoprostol and 0.55 g/dL for oxytocin; relative difference 9.6%; 95% CI
      20.5-39.6%; P = 0.54). There were no significant differences in secondary
      outcomes with the exception of shivering, which occurred more frequently in the
      misoprostol group (22.2% vs 5.7%; relative risk 4.73; 95% CI 2.31-9.68; P <
      0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In low risk women oral misoprostol appears to be as
      effective in minimising blood loss in the third stage of labour as intramuscular 
      oxytocin. Shivering was noted more frequently with misoprostol use, but no other 
      side effects were noted. Misoprostol has great potential for use in the third
      stage of labour especially in developing countries.

TI  - Tailored fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide compared with
      marrow-supported high-dose chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for high-risk
      breast cancer: a randomised trial. Scandinavian Breast Group 9401 study.
PG  - 1384-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy drug distribution varies greatly among individual
      patients. Therefore, we developed an individualised fluorouracil, epirubicin,
      cyclophosphamide (FEC) regimen to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk
      early breast cancer. We then did a randomised trial to compare this individually 
      tailored FEC regimen with conventional adjuvant chemotherapy followed by
      consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support. METHODS: 525
      women younger than 60 years of age with high-risk primary breast cancer were
      randomised after surgery to receive nine cycles of tailored FEC to haematological
      equitoxicity with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support (n=251), 
      or three cycles of FEC at standard doses followed by high-dose chemotherapy with 
      cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (CTCb), and peripheral-blood
      stem-cell or bone-marrow support (n=274). Both groups received locoregional
      radiation therapy and tamoxifen for 5 years. The primary outcome measure was
      relapse-free survival, and analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: At a
      median follow-up of 34.3 months, there were 81 breast-cancer relapses in the
      tailored FEC group versus 113 in the CTCb group (double triangular method
      p=0.04). 60 deaths occurred in the tailored FEC group and 82 in the CTCb group
      (log-rank p=0.12). Patients in the CTCb group experienced more grade 3 or 4 acute
      toxicity compared with the tailored FEC group (p<0.0001). Two treatment-related
      deaths (0.7%) occurred in the CTCb group. Six patients in the tailored FEC group 
      developed acute myeloid leukaemia and three developed myelodysplastic syndrome.
      INTERPRETATION: Tailored FEC with G-CSF support resulted in a significantly
      improved relapse-free survival and fewer grade 3 and 4 toxicities compared with
      marrow-supported high-dose chemotherapy with CTCb as adjuvant therapy of women
      with high-risk primary breast cancer.

TI  - Three minute, but not one minute, ischemia and nicorandil have a preconditioning 
      effect in patients with coronary artery disease.
PG  - 345-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study focused on 1) the determination of the optimal
      preconditioning (PC) duration, and 2) the protective effect of nicorandil (NC), a
      hybrid nitrate with a KATP channel opening effect, during a percutaneous
      transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) model in humans. BACKGROUND: The
      ischemic PC effect is induced in 180 s ischemia, but not in 120 s ischemia in
      rabbit hearts. However, the duration of ischemia that induces PC effect and the
      role of the KATP channel in the PC effect in humans are still unclear. METHODS:
      Forty-six patients with stable angina were randomly allocated to four groups: the
      duration of the first inflation as PC ischemia was 60 s in the PC60 group (n =
      12), and 180 s in the PC180 group (n = 12). In the other groups, NC (80
      microg/kg) was intravenously given for 1 min in the NC group (n = 12), and
      isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) (40 microg/kg) was given in the ISDN group (n = 10). 
      Five minutes after first inflation or drug administration, a second inflation was
      conducted for 120 s in each group. In the ECG, the lead with the largest shift in
      ST segment (deltaST max), and the sum of elevated ST levels in all leads
      (sigmaST) were determined. RESULTS: In the PC60 group, no significant difference 
      was observed in either deltaST max or sigmaST between the first and second
      inflation. However, the second inflation in the PC180 group showed significantly 
      lower levels of deltaST max and sigmaST compared with those of the first
      inflation. In the NC group, both deltaST max and sigmaST measured at 30 s and 60 
      s after balloon inflation were significantly lower than those of the first
      inflation in the PC60 and PC180 control groups. In the ISDN group, no significant
      difference was observed in deltaST max or sigmaST. CONCLUSION: In human PTCA
      models, a PC effect is observed in 180 s ischemia, but not in 60 s ischemia. A
      pharmacological PC effect is induced by NC, a KATP channel opener with a
      nitrate-like effect but not ISDN. This suggests that the opening of KATP channels
      plays an important role in the protecting effect of NC.

TI  - Placebo-controlled trial of glycine added to clozapine in schizophrenia.
PG  - 826-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of high-dose
      oral glycine on positive and negative symptoms and cognitive function when added 
      to clozapine in adults with schizophrenia. METHOD: The authors conducted a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial of 60 g/day of glycine
      added to clozapine for 8 weeks in 30 adults with schizophrenia. Clinical ratings 
      were performed every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed the trial.
      Glycine augmentation of clozapine produced no statistically significant change in
      positive or negative symptoms or cognitive functioning. No subjects showed
      clinically significant worsening of clinical ratings. CONCLUSIONS: These data,
      combined with data from previous trials with D-cycloserine and glycine, suggest
      that agonists at the glycine site may be less effective when combined with
      clozapine than they are when combined with conventional antipsychotics.

TI  - Long-term renoprotective effect of nisoldipine and lisinopril in type 1 diabetic 
      patients with diabetic nephropathy.
PG  - 1725-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term effect on kidney function of a long-acting
      calcium antagonist (nisoldipine) versus a long-acting ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) 
      in hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a 4-year prospective, randomized, double-dummy
      controlled study comparing nisoldipine (20-40 mg once a day) with lisinopril
      (10-20 mg once a day). The study was double-blinded for the first year and
      single-blinded thereafter. The study included 51 hypertensive type 1 diabetic
      patients with diabetic nephropathy. Three patients dropped out during the first
      month; results for the remaining 48 patients are presented. RESULTS: At baseline,
      the two groups were comparable: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 85 +/- 5 and
      85 +/- 6 ml x min(-1) x [1.73 m](-2); mean 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was 108
      +/- 3 and 105 +/- 2 mmHg, and albuminuria was 1,554 mg/24 h (95% CI 980-2,465)
      and 1,033 mg/24 h (760-1,406) in the lisinopril and nisoldipine groups,
      respectively. Mean 24-h arterial blood pressure during the study did not differ
      between the lisinopril and nisoldipine groups (100 +/- 2 and 103 +/- 1 mmHg,
      respectively). The time-course of albuminuria differed between groups (P <
      0.001). Whereas initiation of treatment with lisinopril resulted in a reduction
      from baseline albuminuria by 52% (95% CI 14-73), albuminuria in the nisoldipine
      group did not change throughout the study GFR declined in a biphasic manner with 
      an initial (0-6 months) reduction of 1.3 +/- 0.3 ml x min(-1) x month(-1) in the 
      lisinopril group compared with 0.2 +/- 0.4 ml x min(-1) x month(-1) in the
      nisoldipine group (P < 0.01). The subsequent sustained decline (6 to 48 months or
      the end of treatment) was identical in the two groups: 0.5 +/- 0.1 ml min(-1) x
      month(-1) (NS). Two patients in the lisinopril group and three patients in the
      nisoldipine group entered therapy for end-stage renal failure. CONCLUSIONS:
      Long-term treatment with lisinopril or nisoldipine has similar beneficial effects
      on progression of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients.

TI  - Intravenous lidocaine in central pain: a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      psychophysical study.
PG  - 564-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of systemic administration of lidocaine on 
      different components of neuropathic central pains by quantitative sensory
      testing. METHODS: The efficacy of systemic lidocaine (5 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes)
      was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and cross-over fashion, on
      both spontaneous ongoing pain and evoked pains (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in 16
      patients with chronic poststroke (n = 6) or spinal cord injury (n = 10) related
      pain. RESULTS: Lidocaine was significantly superior to the placebo (saline) in
      reducing the intensity of spontaneous ongoing pain for up to 45 minutes after the
      injection: 10 of 16 patients (62.5%) receiving lidocaine showed a significant
      reduction in spontaneous pain, whereas only six patients showed this after the
      placebo. Lidocaine also significantly reduced the intensity of brush-induced
      allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia, but was no better than the placebo against
      thermal allodynia and hyperalgesia. In general, the side effects were moderate
      and consisted mainly of lightheadedness (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic lidocaine
      can induce a significant and selective reduction of several components of pain
      caused by CNS injuries. The observed preferential antihyperalgesic and
      antiallodynic effects of this drug suggest a selective central action on the
      mechanisms underlying these evoked pains.

TI  - Effect of metformin and rosiglitazone combination therapy in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1695-702
AB  - CONTEXT: Most antidiabetic agents target only 1 of several underlying causes of
      diabetes. The complementary actions of the antidiabetic agents metformin
      hydrochloride and rosiglitazone maleate may maintain optimal glycemic control in 
      patients with type 2 diabetes; therefore, their combined use may be indicated for
      patients whose diabetes is poorly controlled by metformin alone. OBJECTIVE: To
      evaluate the efficacy of metformin-rosiglitazone therapy in patients whose type 2
      diabetes is inadequately controlled with metformin alone. DESIGN: Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from April 1997 and March 1998. SETTING:
      Thirty-six outpatient centers in the United States. PATIENTS: Three hundred
      forty-eight patients aged 40 to 80 years with a mean fasting plasma glucose level
      of 12.0 mmol/L (216 mg/dL), a mean glycosylated hemoglobin level of 8.8%, and a
      mean body mass index of 30.1 kg/m2 were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were 
      assigned to receive 2.5 g/d of metformin plus placebo (n = 116); 2.5 g/d of
      metformin plus 4 mg/d of rosiglitazone (n = 119); or 2.5 g/d of metformin and 8
      mg/d of rosiglitazone (n = 113) for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glycosylated
      hemoglobin levels, fasting plasma glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and
      beta-cell function, compared between baseline and week 26, by treatment group.
      RESULTS: Glycosylated hemoglobin levels, fasting plasma glucose levels, insulin
      sensitivity, and beta-cell function improved significantly with
      metformin-rosiglitazone therapy in a dose-dependent manner. The mean levels of
      glycosylated hemoglobin decreased by 1.0% in the 4 mg/d metformin-rosiglitazone
      group and by 1.2% in the 8 mg/d metformin-rosiglitazone group and fasting plasma 
      glucose levels by 2.2 mmol/L (39.8 mg/dL) and 2.9 mmol/L (52.9 mg/dL) compared
      with the metformin-placebo group (P<.001 for all). Of patients receiving 8 mg/d
      of metformin-rosiglitazone, 28.1% achieved a glycosylated hemoglobin level of 7% 
      or less [corrected]. Dose-dependent increases in body weight and total and
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed (P<.001 for both
      rosiglitazone groups vs placebo). The proportion of patients reporting adverse
      experiences was comparable across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that 
      combination treatment with once-daily metformin-rosiglitazone improves glycemic
      control, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function more effectively than
      treatment with metformin alone.

TI  - A randomized trial of oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy on bone 
      mineral density and coronary heart disease risk factors in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 87-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the effects of oral contraceptive (OC) and hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) on bone mineral density and coronary heart disease risk
      factors in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Eighty healthy postmenopausal women
      were randomly assigned to a cyclic regimen of OC containing 30 microg of ethinyl 
      estradiol and 150 microg of desogestrel or HRT containing 0.625 mg of conjugated 
      equine estrogens 21 days per cycle and 5 mg of medrogestone 10 days per cycle for
      12 months. Bone mineral density of lumbar spine and hip, biochemical markers of
      bone turnover, lipid-lipoprotein profiles, coagulation profiles, fasting plasma
      glucose, and blood pressure were evaluated. RESULTS: Both regimens caused
      significant increase in bone mineral density of lumbar spine, trochanter,
      intertrochanteric region, total hip, and Ward triangle. Only OC therapy was
      associated with a significant increase in femoral neck bone mineral density (mean
      score +/- standard error 2.5% +/- 0.7%, P < .01). Biochemical markers of bone
      turnover, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased
      significantly in both groups. Posttreatment levels of those bone markers and
      lipid-lipoprotein were significantly lower after OC therapy than HRT. Fasting
      plasma glucose and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both
      groups; however, only the OC group showed a significant decrease in diastolic
      blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Both OC and HRT increased bone mineral density of

TI  - Ondansetron versus placebo for prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in patients
      undergoing ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
PG  - 60-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a common problem in patients
      undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron given at the induction of anesthesia in
      patients scheduled for ambulatory LC. METHODS: A total of 84 patients undergoing 
      ambulatory LC were enrolled in a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study in
      which the subjects received either placebo or 4 mg ondansetron intravenously at
      induction of anesthesia. A nausea scoring system was employed utilizing a 5-point
      linear scale, with 1 point given for no nausea and a maximum of 5 points for an
      episode of emesis. Each patient received a total of four scores postoperatively. 
      RESULTS: The patients receiving placebo had significantly more episodes of nausea
      (53 versus 32; P <0.009) and emesis (11 versus 2; P <0.02), higher mean total
      nausea scores (7.2 versus 5.4; P <0.006), and need for additional postoperative
      antiemetics (23 versus 14; P <0.05) than those receiving ondansetron.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
      ondansetron at induction was highly effective in decreasing postoperative nausea 
      and vomiting and should become the standard.

TI  - Effect of niacin on lipid and lipoprotein levels and glycemic control in patients
      with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease: the ADMIT study: A randomized
      trial. Arterial Disease Multiple Intervention Trial.
PG  - 1263-70
AB  - CONTEXT: Although niacin increases low levels of high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C), which frequently accompany diabetes, current guidelines do
      not recommend use of niacin in patients with diabetes because of concerns about
      adverse effects on glycemic control; however, this is based on limited clinical
      data. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of lipid-modifying dosages 
      of niacin in patients with diabetes. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, randomized 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 6 clinical centers from August
      1993 to December 1995. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 468 participants, including 125
      with diabetes, who had diagnosed peripheral arterial disease. INTERVENTIONS:
      After an active run-in period, participants were randomly assigned to receive
      niacin (crystalline nicotinic acid), 3000 mg/d or maximum tolerated dosage (n =
      64 with diabetes; n = 173 without diabetes), or placebo (n = 61 with diabetes; n 
      = 170 without diabetes) for up to 60 weeks (12-week active run-in and 48-week
      double-blind). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma lipoprotein, glucose, hemoglobin
      A(1c) (HbA(1c)), alanine aminotransferase, and uric acid levels; hypoglycemic
      drug use; compliance; and adverse events, in patients with diabetes vs without
      who were receiving niacin vs placebo. RESULTS: Niacin use significantly increased
      HDL-C by 29% and 29% and decreased triglycerides by 23% and 28% and low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 8% and 9%, respectively, in participants with 
      and without diabetes (P<.001 for niacin vs placebo for all). Corresponding
      changes in participants receiving placebo were increases of 0% and 2% in HDL-C
      and increases of 7% and 0% in triglycerides, and increases of 1% and 1% in LDL-C.
      Glucose levels were modestly increased by niacin (8.7 and 6.3 mg/dL [0.4 and 0.3 
      mmol/L]; P =.04 and P<.001) in participants with and without diabetes,
      respectively. Levels of HbA(1c) were unchanged from baseline to follow-up in
      participants with diabetes treated with niacin. In participants with diabetes
      treated with placebo, HbA(1c) decreased by 0.3% (P =.04 for difference). There
      were no significant differences in niacin discontinuation, niacin dosage, or
      hypoglycemic therapy in participants with diabetes assigned to niacin vs placebo.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that lipid-modifying dosages of niacin can be
      safely used in patients with diabetes and that niacin therapy may be considered
      as an alternative to statin drugs or fibrates for patients with diabetes in whom 
      these agents are not tolerated or fail to sufficiently correct
      hypertriglyceridemia or low HDL-C levels. JAMA. 2000;284:1263-1270

TI  - Effect of providing cancer patients with the audiotaped initial consultation on
      satisfaction, recall, and quality of life: a randomized, double-blind study.
PG  - 3052-60
AB  - PURPOSE: By means of a randomized double-blind study, the effect of providing
      taped initial consultations on cancer patients' satisfaction, recall, and quality
      of life was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive cancer patients
      referred to either the gynecology or medical oncology outpatient clinic were
      eligible. Initial consultations were audiotaped. Patients were either provided
      with the tape (experimental group) or not (control group). Baseline variables
      included sociodemographics, preferences for information, coping styles, and
      clinical characteristics. Follow-up (after 1 week and 3 months) variables
      included attitudes toward the intervention, satisfaction, recall, and quality of 
      life. Assessments took place through mailed questionnaires and telephone
      interviews. RESULTS: Two hundred one patients were included (response, 71%), 105 
      in the experimental group and 96 in the control group. Most patients (75%)
      listened to the tape, the majority of which (73%) listened with others. Almost
      all patients, both in the experimental group (96%) and control group (98%) were
      positive about the intervention. Expectations were confirmed; patients provided
      with the tape were more satisfied (P <.05) and recalled more information (P <.01)
      than patients without the tape. The intervention did not have an effect on
      quality of life. An interaction effect was found between the intervention and
      patients' age on satisfaction with the taped consultation (P <.01) and recall of 
      diagnostic information (P <.01); access to tapes seems more helpful in enhancing 
      satisfaction in younger patients and recall of diagnostic information in older
      patients. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients and their families value the taped initial 
      consultation. This intervention enhances their satisfaction and improves their
      recall of information. Tapes seem more helpful in enhancing satisfaction in
      younger patients and recall of diagnostic information in older patients.

TI  - Randomized trial of neoadjuvant cisplatin, vincristine, bleomycin, and radical
      hysterectomy versus radiation therapy for bulky stage IB and IIA cervical cancer.
PG  - 1740-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by
      radical hysterectomy with that of radiotherapy (R/T) for bulky early-stage
      cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with previously untreated bulky
      (primary tumor >/= 4 cm) stage IB or IIA non-small-cell carcinoma of the uterine 
      cervix were randomly assigned to receive either cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) and
      vincristine 1 mg/m(2) for 1 day and bleomycin 25 mg/m(2) for 3 days for three
      cycles followed by radical hysterectomy (NAC arm) or receive primary pelvic
      radiotherapy only (R/T arm). The ratio of patient allocation was 6:4 for the NAC 
      and R/T arms. Women with enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes on image study were
      ineligible unless results of cytologic or histologic studies were negative.
      RESULTS: Of the 124 eligible patients, 68 in the NAC arm and 52 in the R/T arm
      could be evaluated. The median duration of follow-up was 39 months. Thirty-one
      percent of patients in the NAC arm and 27% in the R/T arm had relapse or
      persistent diseases after treatment, and 21% in each group died of disease.
      Estimated cumulative survival rates at 2 years were 81% for the NAC arm and 84%
      for the R/T arm; the 5-year rates were 70% and 61%, respectively. There were no
      significant differences in disease-free survival and overall survival.
      CONCLUSION: NAC followed by radical hysterectomy and primary R/T showed similar
      efficacy for bulky stage IB or IIA cervical cancer. Further study to identify
      patient subgroups better suited for either treatment modality and to evaluate the
      concurrent use of cisplatin and radiation without routine hysterectomy is
      necessary.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of the effect of needle gauge and local anaesthetic on 
      the pain of breast fine-needle aspiration cytology.
PG  - 777-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is an invasive
      investigation which can be uncomfortable or distressing. This randomized study
      investigated the discomfort of breast FNAC and the effect of different
      techniques. METHODS: Some 116 FNAC samples were taken from 98 women with a
      palpable breast mass. Each patient was randomized to one of four study groups;
      aspiration was performed using a green-hub (21 G) or blue-hub (23 G) needle,
      either with or without local anaesthetic. Each patient scored the pain of the
      whole procedure using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: A green-hub needle caused
      significantly more discomfort (mean(s.e.m.) pain score 5.1(0. 4) cm) than a
      blue-hub needle (2.9(0.4) cm), or either a blue- or green-hub needle with local
      anaesthetic (3.0(0.4) and 2.1(0.4) cm respectively) (F = 10.28, 3112 d.f., P <
      0.01, analysis of variance). CONCLUSION: The discomfort of breast FNAC is
      dependent upon the gauge of the needle and the use of local anaesthetic. A
      blue-hub needle without local anaesthetic should be first choice for breast FNAC.

      versus placebo.
PG  - 1382-5
AB  - The authors performed a double-blind, double-dummy study to compare the efficacy 
      of verapamil with placebo in the prophylaxis of episodic cluster headache. After 
      5 days' run-in, 15 patients received verapamil (120 mg tid) and 15 received
      placebo (tid) for 14 days. The authors found a significant reduction in attack
      frequency and abortive agents consumption in the verapamil group. Side effects
      were mild. These findings provide objective evidence for the effectiveness of
      verapamil in episodic cluster headache prophylaxis.

      report of feasibility and 6-month outcome.
PG  - 1631-45
AB  - AIM: To assess the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial of supervised
      injectable versus oral methadone maintenance and to assess medium-term treatment 
      outcomes. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial of supervised injectable versus
      supervised oral methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Trial participants were
      dependent illicit opiate injectors allocated at intake to supervised injectable
      or oral methadone maintenance treatment. SETTING: Specialist addictions treatment
      centre in South London. SUBJECTS: Forty dependent illicit opiate injectors
      seeking methadone maintenance treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Daily supervised
      injectable and oral methadone maintenance, delivered at the treatment centre.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of illicit heroin use and frequency of illicit
      drug injecting during 30 days before intake to treatment and prior to 6-month
      follow-up. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: frequency of use of illicit methadone,
      crack cocaine, benzodiazepines and alcohol, physical and psychological health
      symptoms and acquisitive crime. RESULTS: Injectable and oral MMT were both
      generally acceptable to the study participants: there was a high level of
      agreement to enter the randomized trial, and subsequent retention in treatment
      was good. The average number of days of illicit heroin use reduced from 22.2 to
      7.6 for the injectable MMT group and from 22.4 to 8.7 for the oral MMT group. The
      average number of days of illicit injecting reduced from 25.7 to 10.8 days for
      the injectable group and from 20.1 to 11.9 days for the oral group. Patients'
      physical and psychological health symptoms and involvement in acquisitive crime
      also reduced in both groups. Treatment satisfaction ratings at follow-up were
      higher among patients in the injectable MMT group. The ratio for the actual
      medication costs between injectable and oral MMT was 6.8:1, and for the direct
      operational costs was 4.7:1. There was some evidence of a differential patient
      response with greater reductions in heroin use occurring among patients who were 
      daily illicit injectors and had poorer psychological and physical health (at
      entry) who were allocated to injectable MMT. CONCLUSIONS: Conduct of the trial
      has demonstrated that it is feasible to implement supervised injectable methadone
      maintenance treatment in the context of (although separate from) a specialist
      oral methadone maintenance service. Patients assigned to receive either
      supervised injectable or oral MMT had broadly equivalent, positive
      during-treatment outcomes at 6-month follow-up. Future studies should seek to
      identify patient characteristics which are linked to good outcome in injectable
      MMT. Practical evidence-based guidance to physicians about determining which
      patients are more suitable for injectable MMT is urgently needed.

TI  - Prospectively randomized comparison of different mechanical aortic valves.
PG  - III1-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospectively randomized study was to evaluate the
      hemodynamic and functional outcomes after aortic valve replacement with 3
      different bileaflet mechanical valves. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred
      consecutive patients were randomly assigned to receive ATS (n=100), Carbomedics
      (n=100), or St Jude Medical Hemodynamic Plus (n=100) mechanical aortic valve
      replacement. There were no significant differences regarding patient age (average
      61+/-8 years), body surface area (1.9+/-0.2 m(2)), left ventricular function
      (ejection fraction 0.59+/-0.17), and presence of aortic stenosis (90%, 89%, and
      91%), respectively. All patients had postoperative as well as 6-month and 1-year 
      follow-ups that included transthoracic echocardiography. Multivariate statistical
      analysis was performed. Implanted valve sizes were comparable at 24+/-2 (ATS),
      23.7+/-1.6 (CM), and 23.6+/-1.9 (SJMHP) mm (NS). At 1-year follow-up, the
      following incidence of events was noted: death 3/1/1, all non-valve related;
      stroke 0/1/1; trivial transvalvular incompetence 3/3/2; paravalvular leak 2/3/2; 
      and reoperation 0/1/1, respectively (NS). Transvalvular flow velocities were
      2.5/2.6/2.4 m/s postoperatively (P:=0.03) and 2.4/2.4/2.3 m/s at 6-month
      follow-up, respectively (NS). There was a significant decrease in left
      ventricular mass for all patients but no significant differences among the
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are no clinically relevant differences among the
      tested bileaflet aortic valves. Regardless of valve type, there was a low
      complication rate. On the basis of these findings, all 3 bileaflet prostheses are
      well suited for aortic valve replacement.

TI  - Use of insulin pump therapy at nighttime only for children 7-10 years of age with
      type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 579-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because of age-related developmental and cognitive issues, children
      <10 years of age may not be able to wear an insulin pump safely when they are not
      under direct parental supervision. The purpose of this study was to determine if 
      insulin pump therapy at nighttime only, when children are at home, could improve 
      fasting and nighttime blood glucose levels without adverse effects. RESEARCH
      DESIGN AND METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 10 children aged 7-10 years. A 
      randomized crossover design was used to compare nighttime-only pump usage from
      dinner and throughout the night, combined with a prebreakfast injection of
      intermediate-acting NPH and rapid-acting lispro insulin, with 3 insulin
      injections per day. Comparisons were made among mean blood glucose values and
      percentage of blood glucose levels within the target range (70-150 mg/dl) before 
      meals, at bedtime, and at 3:00 A.M.; serum fructosamine levels; and scores on
      measures of adherence and fear of hypoglycemia. RESULTS: Compared with baseline
      levels, the use of the pump resulted in a significant decrease in the mean
      average (P < 0.001), breakfast (P < 0.0001), and 3:00 A.M. (P < 0.003) blood
      glucose levels. There was a decrease in the percentage of blood glucose values
      less than the target range (P < 0.01) and in fructosamine (P < 0.01) values and
      an increase in the percentage of blood glucose levels within the target range (P 
      < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Nighttime-only insulin pump therapy may be a viable
      alternative that young children can use to improve glycemia when they are not
      capable of independently managing an insulin pump.

TI  - Videotape-based decision aid for colon cancer screening. A randomized, controlled
      trial.
PG  - 761-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rates of colon cancer screening in the United States are low, in part
      because of poor communication between patients and providers about the
      availability of effective screening options. OBJECTIVE: To test whether a
      decision aid consisting of an educational video, targeted brochure, and chart
      marker increased performance of colon cancer screening in primary care practices.
      DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Three community primary care
      practices in central North Carolina. PATIENTS: 1657 consecutive adult patients 50
      to 75 years of age were contacted. Of these, 651 (39%) agreed to participate; 249
      of the 651 participants (38%) were eligible. Eligible patients had no personal or
      family history of colon cancer and had not had fecal occult blood testing in the 
      past year or flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or barium enema in the past 5
      years. INTERVENTION: The 249 participants were randomly assigned to view an
      11-minute video about colon cancer screening (intervention group) or a video
      about automobile safety (control group). After viewing the video, intervention
      group participants chose a color-coded educational brochure (based on stages of
      change) to indicate their degree of interest in screening. A chart marker of the 
      same color was attached to their charts. Controls received a generic brochure on 
      automobile safety, and no chart marker was attached. MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of
      screening test ordering as reported by participants and frequency of completion
      of screening tests as verified by chart review. RESULTS: Fecal occult blood
      testing or flexible sigmoidoscopy was ordered for 47.2% of intervention
      participants and 26.4% of controls (difference, 20.8 percentage points [95% CI,
      8.6 to 32.9 percentage points]). Screening tests were completed by 36.8% of the
      intervention group and 22.6% of the control group (difference, 14.2 percentage
      points [CI, 3.0 to 25.4 percentage points]). CONCLUSION: A decision aid
      consisting of an educational video, brochure, and chart marker increased ordering
      and performance of colon cancer screening tests.

TI  - Effects of different doses in continuous veno-venous haemofiltration on outcomes 
      of acute renal failure: a prospective randomised trial.
PG  - 26-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous veno-venous haemofiltration is increasingly used to treat 
      acute renal failure in critically ill patients, but a clear definition of an
      adequate treatment dose has not been established. We undertook a prospective
      randomised study of the impact different ultrafiltration doses in continuous
      renal replacement therapy on survival. METHODS: We enrolled 425 patients, with a 
      mean age of 61 years, in intensive care who had acute renal failure. Patients
      were randomly assigned ultrafiltration at 20 mL h(-1) kg(-1) (group 1, n=146), 35
      mL h(-1) kg(-1) (group 2, n=139), or 45 mL h(-1) kg(-1) (group 3, n=140). The
      primary endpoint was survival at 15 days after stopping haemofiltration. We also 
      assessed recovery of renal function and frequency of complications during
      treatment. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: Survival in group 1 was
      significantly lower than in groups 2 (p=0.0007) and 3 (p=0.0013). Survival in
      groups 2 and 3 did not differ significantly (p=0.87). Adjustment for possible
      confounding factors did not change the pattern of differences among the groups.
      Survivors in all groups had lower concentrations of blood urea nitrogen before
      continuous haemofiltration was started than non-survivors. 95%, 92%, and 90% of
      survivors in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, had full recovery of renal
      function. The frequency of complications was similarly low in all groups.
      INTERPRETATION: Mortality among these critically ill patients was high, but
      increase in the rate of ultrafiltration improved survival significantly. We
      recommend that ultrafiltration should be prescribed according to patient's
      bodyweight and should reach at least 35 mL h(-1) kg(-1).

TI  - Pool exercise combined with an education program for patients with fibromyalgia
      syndrome. A prospective, randomized study.
PG  - 2473-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of 6 months of pool exercise combined with a 6
      session education program for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM). METHODS: 
      The study population comprised 58 patients, randomized to a treatment or a
      control group. Patients were instructed to match the pool exercises to their
      threshold of pain and fatigue. The education focused on strategies for coping
      with symptoms and encouragement of physical activity. The primary outcome
      measurements were the total score of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) 
      and the 6 min walk test, recorded at study start and after 6 mo. Several other
      tests and instruments assessing functional limitations, severity of symptoms,
      disabilities, and quality of life were also applied. RESULTS: Significant
      differences between the treatment group and the control group were found for the 
      FIQ total score (p = 0.017) and the 6 min walk test (p < 0.0001). Significant
      differences were also found for physical function, grip strength, pain severity, 
      social functioning, psychological distress, and quality of life. CONCLUSION: The 
      results suggest that a 6 month program of exercises in a temperate pool combined 
      with education will improve the consequences of FM.

TI  - Effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B6 on
      progression of subclinical atherosclerosis: a randomised, placebo-controlled
      trial.
PG  - 517-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high plasma homocysteine concentration is associated with increased
      risk of atherothrombotic disease. We investigated the effects of
      homocysteine-lowering treatment (folic acid plus vitamin B6) on markers of
      subclinical atherosclerosis among healthy siblings of patients with premature
      atherothrombotic disease. METHODS: We did a randomised, placebo-controlled trial 
      among 158 healthy siblings of 167 patients with premature atherothrombotic
      disease. 80 were assigned placebo and 78 were assigned 5 mg folic acid and 250 mg
      vitamin B6 daily for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the development or
      progression of subclinical atherosclerosis as estimated from exercise
      electrocardiography, the ankle-brachial pressure index, and carotid and femoral
      ultrasonography. FINDINGS: Ten participants in the treatment group, and 14 in the
      placebo group dropped out. Vitamin treatment, compared with placebo, was
      associated with a decrease in fasting homocysteine concentration (from 14.7 to
      7.4 micromol/L vs from 14.7 to 12.0 micromol/L), and in postmethionine
      homocysteine concentration (from 64.9 to 34.9 micromol/L vs from 64.8 to 50.3
      micromol/L). It was also associated with a decreased rate of abnormal exercise
      electrocardiography tests (odds ratio 0.40 [0.17-0.93]; p=0.035). There was no
      apparent effect of vitamin treatment on ankle-brachial pressure indices (0.87
      [0.56-1.33]), or on carotid and peripheral-arterial outcome variables (1.02
      [0.26-4.05] and 0.86 [0.47-1.59], respectively). INTERPRETATION:
      Homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B6 in healthy
      siblings of patients with premature atherothrombotic disease is associated with a
      decreased occurrence of abnormal exercise electrocardiography tests, which is
      consistent with a decreased risk of atherosclerotic coronary events.

TI  - Controlled trial of immune response of preterm infants to recombinant hepatitis B
      and inactivated poliovirus vaccines administered simultaneously shortly after
      birth.
PG  - F24-7
AB  - AIM: The study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of an early, extra
      dose of enhanced inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) administered simultaneously
      with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) to preterm infants shortly after
      birth. METHODS: Three groups were studied. Fifty preterm infants received IPV
      intramuscularly within 24 hours of birth, in addition to routine recommended
      childhood immunisations. Fifty two preterm infants and 35 full term infants
      received routine immunisations only (routine vaccination timing: HBV at birth, 1 
      and 6 months of age; IPV at 2 and 4 months; oral polio vaccine (OPV) at 4 and 6
      months; diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) at 2, 4, and 6 months; and Haemophilus
      influenzae B vaccine at 2 and 4 months). Blood samples were taken at birth, 3 and
      7 months of age from all infants, and at 1 month of age from preterm infants
      only. RESULTS: At birth, a lower percentage of both study and control preterm
      infants had antipoliovirus type 3 titres >/= 1:8 than full term infants. At 1 and
      3 months of age significantly more early IPV infants had antipoliovirus type 3
      titres >/= 1:8 than routinely vaccinated preterm infants (p < 0.05). At 7 months 
      of age there were no significant differences in percentage of antipoliovirus
      titres >/= 1:8 or geometric mean times (GMTs) between the early IPV group and the
      routinely vaccinated preterm group. At 3 and 7 months of age, the percentage of
      positive antihepatitis B titres (>/= 1:10) and the GMT of the early IPV preterm
      group did not differ significantly from those of preterm controls. There was no
      significant difference in percentage of positive antihepatitis B titres between
      the early IPV group and full term controls at any time. GMTs for hepatitis B
      antibodies were significantly lower in the early IPV preterm group than in full
      term controls at 3 and 7 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of an
      additional dose of IPV simultaneously with routine HBV to preterm infants shortly
      after birth provides early protection from poliovirus and hepatitis B infection, 
      and does not interfere with poliovirus antibody production at the age of 7
      months.

TI  - The effects of patient communication skills training on compliance.
PG  - 57-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between communication skills training for 
      patients and their compliance with recommended treatment. DESIGN: A randomized
      control design was used, with patients nested within physicians. Each physician
      was audiotaped with 6 patients, 2 patients in each of the 3 intervention
      conditions: (1) a trained group (n = 50) received a training booklet in the mail 
      2 to 3 days prior to the scheduled appointment, (2) an informed group (n = 49)
      received a brief written summary of the major points contained in the training
      booklet while in the waiting room prior to the scheduled appointment, and (3) an 
      untrained group (n = 51) did not receive any form of communication skills
      intervention. SETTING: Participants included physicians and patients from 9
      different primary care, family practice locations. Two locations were clinics
      associated with a large, university-based medical school and hospital, while 7
      were private practice offices in the community. PARTICIPANTS: The sample included
      25 family physicians (averaging 11 years postresidency) and 150 patients.
      Patients were randomly selected from appointment records and randomly assigned to
      1 of 3 intervention conditions. INTERVENTION: A training booklet designed to
      instruct patients in information seeking, provision, and verification. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Patients' compliance with medications, behavioral treatment
      (e.g., diet, exercise, smoking cessation), and/or follow-up appointments and
      referrals. RESULTS: Trained patients were more compliant overall than untrained
      or informed patients. Training positively influenced compliance with behavioral
      treatments and follow-up appointments and referrals. CONCLUSION: Training
      patients in communication skills may be a cost-effective way of increasing
      compliance and improving the overall health of patients.

TI  - Transthoracic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: comparison of rectilinear
      biphasic versus damped sine wave monophasic shocks.
PG  - 1282-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have shown that biphasic shocks are more effective
      than monophasic shocks for ventricular defibrillation. The purpose of this study 
      was to compare the efficacy of a rectilinear biphasic waveform with a standard
      damped sine wave monophasic waveform for the transthoracic cardioversion of
      atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective, randomized,
      multicenter trial, patients undergoing transthoracic cardioversion of atrial
      fibrillation were randomized to receive either damped sine wave monophasic or
      rectilinear biphasic shocks. Patients randomized to the monophasic protocol
      (n=77) received sequential shocks of 100, 200, 300, and 360 J. Patients
      randomized to the biphasic protocol (n=88) received sequential shocks of 70, 120,
      150, and 170 J. First-shock efficacy with the 70-J biphasic waveform (60 of 88
      patients, 68%) was significantly greater than that with the 100-J monophasic
      waveform (16 of 77 patients, 21%, P<0.0001), and it was achieved with 50% less
      delivered current (11+/-1 versus 22+/-4 A, P<0.0001). Similarly, the cumulative
      efficacy with the biphasic waveform (83 of 88 patients, 94%) was significantly
      greater than that with the monophasic waveform (61 of 77 patients, 79%; P=0.005).
      The following 3 variables were independently associated with successful
      cardioversion: use of a biphasic waveform (relative risk, 4.2; 95% confidence
      intervals, 1.3 to 13.9; P=0.02), transthoracic impedance (relative risk, 0.64 per
      10-Omega increase in impedance; 95% confidence intervals, 0.46 to 0.90; P=0.005),
      and duration of atrial fibrillation (relative risk, 0.97 per 30 days of atrial
      fibrillation; 95% confidence intervals, 0.96 to 0.99; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: For
      transthoracic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, rectilinear biphasic shocks
      have greater efficacy (and require less energy) than damped sine wave monophasic 
      shocks.

TI  - A multicenter controlled trial of fetal pulse oximetry in the intrapartum
      management of nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns.
PG  - 1049-58
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent developments permit the use of pulse oximetry to evaluate fetal
      oxygenation in labor. We tested the hypothesis that the addition of fetal pulse
      oximetry in the evaluation of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns in labor
      improves the accuracy of fetal assessment and allows safe reduction of cesarean
      deliveries performed because of nonreassuring fetal status. STUDY DESIGN: A
      randomized, controlled trial was conducted concurrently in 9 centers. The
      patients had term pregnancies and were in active labor when abnormal fetal heart 
      rate patterns developed. The patients were randomized to electronic fetal heart
      rate monitoring alone (control group) or to the combination of electronic fetal
      monitoring and continuous fetal pulse oximetry (study group). The primary outcome
      was a reduction in cesarean deliveries for nonreassuring fetal status as a
      measure of improved accuracy of assessment of fetal oxygenation. RESULTS: A total
      of 1010 patients were randomized, 502 to the control group and 508 to the study
      group. There was a reduction of >50% in the number of cesarean deliveries
      performed because of nonreassuring fetal status in the study group (study, 4. 5%;
      vs. control, 10.2%; P =.007). However, there was no net difference in overall
      cesarean delivery rates (study, n = 147 [29%]; vs. control, 130 [26%]; P = .49)
      because of an increase in cesarean deliveries performed because of dystocia in
      the study group. In a blinded partogram analysis 89% of the study patients and
      91% of the control patients who had a cesarean delivery because of dystocia met
      defined criteria for actual dystocia. There was no difference between the 2
      groups in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. In terms of the operative
      intervention for nonreassuring fetal status, there was an improvement in both the
      sensitivity and the specificity for the study group compared with the control
      group for the end points of metabolic acidosis and need for resuscitation.
      CONCLUSION: The study confirmed its primary hypothesis of a safe reduction in
      cesarean deliveries performed because of nonreassuring fetal status. However, the
      addition of fetal pulse oximetry did not result in an overall reduction in
      cesarean deliveries. The increase in cesarean deliveries because of dystocia in
      the study group did appear to result from a well-documented arrest of labor.
      Fetal pulse oximetry improved the obstetrician's ability to more appropriately
      intervene by cesarean or operative vaginal delivery for fetuses who were actually
      depressed and acidotic. The unexpected increase in operative delivery for
      dystocia in the study group is of concern and remains to be explained.

TI  - Hemodynamic comparison of twice daily metoprolol tartrate with once daily
      metoprolol succinate in congestive heart failure.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the hemodynamic effects of twice daily metoprolol tartrate
      (MT) and once daily metoprolol succinate (MS) in congestive heart failure
      patients. BACKGROUND: Adverse hemodynamic effects with MT demonstrated during
      initiation persist with drug readministration during chronic therapy. METHODS:
      Patients were randomly assigned to 6.25 mg MT or 25 mg MS orally and the dose was
      gradually increased to a target of 50 mg twice a day or 100 mg once a day,
      respectively. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained at baseline and after three 
      months of therapy--both before and after drug readministration. RESULTS: Long
      term metoprolol therapy produced significant functional, exercise and hemodynamic
      benefits with no difference in response between either metoprolol preparation in 
      the 27 patients (MT [14], MS [13]). When full dose metoprolol was readministered 
      during chronic therapy, there were parallel adverse hemodynamic effects in both
      drug groups. Cardiac index decreased by 0.6 liters/min/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MT
      and by 0.5 liters/min/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MS. Systematic vascular resistance
      increased by 253 dyne-sec-cm(-5) (p < 0.001) with MT and by 267 dyne-sec-cm(-5)
      (p < 0.0005) with MS. Stroke volume index decreased by 7.0 ml/m2 (p < 0.0005)
      with MT and by 6.5 ml/m2 (p < 0.0001) with MS, while SWI decreased by 6.2 g-m/m2 
      (p < 0.0005) with MT and by 6.0 g-m/m2 (p < 0.001) with MS. CONCLUSION:
      Metoprolol tartrate and MS produce similar hemodynamic and clinical effects
      acutely and chronically despite the fourfold greater starting dose of MS used in 
      this study. A more rapid initiation with readily available starting doses of MS
      may offer distinct advantages compared with MT in treating chronic heart failure 
      patients with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.

TI  - Anastrozole versus tamoxifen as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer in 
      668 postmenopausal women: results of the Tamoxifen or Arimidex Randomized Group
      Efficacy and Tolerability study.
PG  - 3748-57
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of anastrozole (Arimidex;
      AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE, and Macclesfield, United Kingdom) with that of
      tamoxifen as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer (ABC) in
      postmenopausal women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind,
      multicenter study evaluated the efficacy of anastrozole 1 mg once daily relative 
      to tamoxifen 20 mg once daily in patients with tumors that were hormone
      receptor-positive or of unknown receptor status who were eligible for endocrine
      therapy. The primary end points were time to progression (TTP), objective
      response (OR), and tolerability. RESULTS: A total of 668 patients (340 in the
      anastrozole arm and 328 in the tamoxifen arm) were randomized to treatment and
      followed-up for a median of 19 months. Median TTP was similar for both treatments
      (8.2 months in patients who received anastrozole and 8.3 months in patients who
      received tamoxifen). The tamoxifen:anastrozole hazards ratio was 0.99 (lower
      one-sided 95% confidence limit, 0.86), demonstrating that anastrozole was at
      least equivalent to tamoxifen. Anastrozole was also as effective as tamoxifen in 
      terms of OR (32.9% of anastrozole and 32.6% of tamoxifen patients achieved a
      complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). Clinical benefit (CR + PR +
      stabilization of > or = 24 weeks) rates were 56.2% and 55.5% for patients
      receiving anastrozole and tamoxifen, respectively. Both treatments were well
      tolerated. However, incidences of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding were
      reported in fewer patients treated with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (4.8% v
      7.3% [thromboembolic events] and 1.2% v 2.4% [vaginal bleeding], respectively).
      CONCLUSION: Anastrozole satisfied the predefined criteria for equivalence to
      tamoxifen. Together with the lower observed incidence of thromboembolic events
      and vaginal bleeding, these findings indicate that anastrozole should be
      considered as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with ABC.

TI  - Tri-iodothyronine treatment in children after cardiac surgery: a double-blind,
      randomised, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 529-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum thyroid hormone concentrations decline transiently during
      critical illness and after surgical procedures. We investigated prospectively the
      endocrine and haemodynamic effects of tri-iodothyronine treatment after
      cardiopulmonary bypass operations in children with congenital cardiac
      malformations. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial, in which 40 children (median age 0.6 years; range 2 days to 10.4 years)
      were randomly assigned placebo (saline) or one daily infusion of
      tri-iodothyronine (2 microg/kg bodyweight on day 1 after surgery and 1 microg/kg 
      bodyweight on subsequent postoperative days up to 12 days after surgery. Before
      and 2 h, 24 h, and 72 h after the first infusion, plasma concentrations of
      thyroid hormones were measured by RIA, and systolic cardiac function was
      evaluated by echocardiography. During the postoperative course intensive-care
      measures were assessed by use of the therapeutic intervention scoring system.
      FINDINGS: In all patients, postoperative plasma concentrations of thyrotropin,
      thyroxine, free thyroxine, tri-iodothyronine were abnormally low and plasma
      concentrations of reverse tri-iodothyronine were raised. After start of
      treatment, tri-iodothyronine was significantly higher in patients given
      tri-iodothyronine than in those receiving placebo, whereas thyrotropin,
      thyroxine, free thyroxine, and reverse tri-iodothyronine remained similar in the 
      two groups. At discharge, thyroid hormones of all patients were within the normal
      range, but thyrotropin secretion increased to plasma concentrations higher than
      those seen before treatment. The mean change of cardiac index was significantly
      higher in children given tri-iodothyronine (20.4% [SD 19.6] vs 10.0% [15.2];
      p=0.004). Systolic cardiac function improved most in patients given
      tri-iodothyronine after longer cardiopulmonary bypass operations. Overall,
      patients given tri-iodothyronine had significantly lower mean treatment scores.
      INTERPRETATION: Treatment of children with tri-iodothyronine after
      cardiopulmonary bypass operations raises tri-iodothyronine plasma concentrations 
      and improves myocardial function especially in patients with low postoperative
      cardiac output without adverse events, and without delaying postoperative
      recovery of thyroid function. Furthermore, tri-iodothyronine reduces the need for
      postoperative intensive care.

TI  - Quality of life after coronary angioplasty or continued medical treatment for
      angina: three-year follow-up in the RITA-2 trial. Randomized Intervention
      Treatment of Angina.
PG  - 907-14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the impact of percutaneous transluminal
      coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and medical treatment on self-perceived quality of
      life among patients with angina. BACKGROUND: The second Randomized Intervention
      Treatment of Angina trial (RITA-2) implemented initial policies of PTCA or
      continued medical treatment in patients with angina, allowing assessment of
      long-term health consequences. METHODS: A total of 1,018 patients were randomly
      assigned (504 to PTCA and 514 to medical treatment). The short form 36 (SF-36)
      self-administered quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at randomization
      and three months, one year and three years later. To date, 98% of patients
      reached one year and 67% reached three years. RESULTS: The PTCA group had
      significantly greater improvements in physical functioning, vitality and general 
      health at both three months and one year, but not at three years. These
      quality-of-life scores were strongly related to breathlessness, angina grade and 
      treadmill exercise time both at baseline and at one year. The treatment
      differences in quality of life are explained by the PTCA group's improvements in 
      breathlessness, angina and exercise time. The attenuation of treatment difference
      at three years is partly attributed to 27% of medically treated patients
      receiving nonrandomized interventions in the interim. For both groups, there were
      also improvements in ratings of physical role functioning, emotional role
      functioning, social functioning, pain and mental health, but for these the
      superiority of PTCA over medical treatment was less pronounced. After one year,
      33% and 22% of the PTCA and medical groups, respectively, rated their health much
      better. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary angioplasty substantially improves
      patient-perceived quality of life, especially physical functioning and vitality, 
      as compared with continued medical treatment. These differences are attributed to
      alleviation of cardiac symptoms (specifically, breathlessness and angina), but
      must be balanced against the small procedure-related risks of PTCA.

TI  - Protective effects of fluticasone on allergen-induced airway responses and sputum
      inflammatory markers.
PG  - 313-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A direct comparison of the protective effects of single and regular
      doses of inhaled glucocorticoid on allergen-induced asthmatic responses and
      inflammation has not been made. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of pretreatment
      with fluticasone 250 microg 30 min before allergen inhalation and two weeks of
      250 microg twice daily (last dose 24 h before challenge) with single and regular 
      (twice daily) placebo doses on early and late asthmatic responses, induced sputum
      cell counts and measures of eosinophil activation at 7 h and 24 h, and
      methacholine airway responsiveness at 24 h. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten mild
      asthmatic patients were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      crossover study. RESULTS: Regular fluticasone increased the baseline mean
      provocative concentration of methacholine to cause a 20% fall (PC20) in forced
      expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from 2.6 to 6.4 mg/mL (P<0.05) and lowered the
      eosinophil count from 3.1% to 0.4% (P<0.05) compared with regular placebo.
      Neither single nor regular fluticasone had any effect on the early asthmatic
      response. Single fluticasone attenuated the late asthmatic response, the mean +/-
      SEM maximum percentage fall in FEV1 (10.8+/-3.6 compared with single placebo 18. 
      8+/-3.5, P=0.03), the allergen-induced increase of airway responsiveness
      (P<0.05), and the eosinophilia (P<0.005) and activated eosinophils at 7 h
      (P<0.01) but not at 24 h. Regular fluticasone also attenuated the late asthmatic 
      response (11.1+/-2.5) compared with regular placebo (19.6+/-4.5), but this was
      not statistically significant and did not protect against the induced increase in
      airway responsiveness or the sputum eosinophilia. CONCLUSION: Two weeks of
      regular inhaled fluticasone discontinued 24 h before allergen challenge does not 
      offer any additional protection against the early or late asthmatic responses,
      increased airway responsiveness or sputum eosinophilia compared with a single
      dose of 250 microg immediately before allergen challenge, despite increasing
      baseline PC20 and decreasing sputum eosinophilia prechallenge. The significance
      of the protective effect of a single dose of inhaled steroid before an allergen
      inhalation and the duration of the protective effect need further investigation.

TI  - Is protease inhibitor a choice for the treatment of pre- or mild disseminated
      intravascular coagulation?
PG  - 1419-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a protease inhibitor, gabexate mesylate, 
      on patients with pre- or mild disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in
      comparison with a control group receiving no anticoagulation therapy. DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: General intensive care unit
      at a general hospital. PATIENTS: Adult patients (40) with a DIC score between 6
      and 8 (pre- or mild DIC). INTERVENTIONS: In 20 patients, gabexate mesylate (2
      mg/kg/hr) was administered as 2 mL/hr in saline (treated group) and in another 20
      patients, saline (2 mL/hr; control group) was administered during the study (7
      days). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following variables were determined at 
      the time of admission to the intensive care unit before treatment and 1, 3, 5,
      and 7 days thereafter: platelet count, antithrombin III activity, serum or plasma
      concentrations of fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product, D-dimer, fibrin
      monomer, thrombin-antithrombin III complex, and plasmin-plasmin inhibitor
      complex, prothrombin time ratio, and DIC score. Two patients in the treated group
      and four in the control group were excluded from the study because they died
      during the study; therefore, 34 patients were analyzed. The measured variables of
      coagulation and fibrinolysis were not significantly different between the two
      groups, except for the D-dimer on day 3 (the treated group showed a higher
      concentration). D-dimer concentration and DIC score went down more quickly in the
      control group than the treated group, but not significantly. The mortality rate
      at 1 month was 40% (8 of 20) in the treated group and 35% (7 of 20) in the
      control group, without any differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In a 
      limited number of patients (n = 34), gabexate mesylate (2 mg/kg/hr) could not
      inhibit coagulation or fibrinolysis and gabexate mesylate could not improve the
      DIC score or mortality rate in pre- or mild DIC.

      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with 100-500/microL absolute
      CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Subjects at each dose level were randomly assigned (3:1) to
      receive rhIL-12 or placebo. Among the 47 subjects enrolled, rhIL-12 was well
      tolerated at doses of 3-300 ng/kg, but 4 of 5 subjects who received rhIL-12 at
      1000 ng/kg had severe adverse events. Dose-related increases in serum
      interferon-gamma occurred after rhIL-12 administration at doses > or =30 ng/kg.
      There was no effect of rhIL-12 on plasma HIV RNA or absolute CD4(+) T cell
      counts. However, dose-related increases in absolute CD8(+) T and NK cells were
      observed in subjects assigned to rhIL-12 doses of 30-300 ng/kg. Single rhIL-12
      doses of 30-300 ng/kg were well tolerated and had biologic activity that could
      potentially be of benefit in the treatment of HIV disease or its complications.

TI  - Comparison of St John's wort and imipramine for treating depression: randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 536-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of Hypericum perforatum (St 
      John's wort extract) with imipramine in patients with mild to moderate
      depression. DESIGN: Randomised, multicentre, double blind, parallel group trial. 
      SETTING: 40 outpatient clinics in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: 324 outpatients with
      mild to moderate depression. INTERVENTION: 75 mg imipramine twice daily or 250 mg
      hypericum extract ZE 117 twice daily for 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hamilton
      depression rating scale, clinical global impression scale, and patient's global
      impression scale. RESULTS: Among the 157 participants taking hypericum mean
      scores on the Hamilton depression scale decreased from 22.4 at baseline to 12.00 
      at end point; among the 167 participants taking imipramine they fell from 22.1 to
      12.75. Mean clinical global impression scores at end point were 2.22 out of 7 for
      the hypericum group and 2.42 for the imipramine group. On the 7 point self
      assessments of global improvement completed by participants (score of 1
      indicating "very much improved" and 7 indicating "very much deteriorated") mean
      scores were 2.44 in the hypericum group and 2.60 in the imipramine group. None of
      the differences between treatment groups were significant. However, the mean
      score on the anxiety-somatisation subscale of the Hamilton scale (3.79 in the
      hypericum group and 4.26 in the imipramine group) indicated a significant
      advantage for hypericum relative to imipramine. Mean scores on the 5 point scale 
      used by participants to assess tolerability (score of 1 indicating excellent
      tolerability and 5 indicating very poor tolerability) were better for hypericum
      (1.67) than imipramine (2.35). Adverse events occurred in 62/157 (39%)
      participants taking hypericum and in 105/167 (63%) taking imipramine. 4 (3%)
      participants taking hypericum withdrew because of adverse events compared with 26
      (16%) taking imipramine. CONCLUSIONS: This Hypericum perforatum extract is
      therapeutically equivalent to imipramine in treating mild to moderate depression,
      but patients tolerate hypericum better.

TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori prevents recurrence of ulcer after simple
      closure of duodenal ulcer perforation: randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 153-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this randomized trial, the authors sought to determine whether
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori could reduce the risk of ulcer recurrence
      after simple closure of perforated duodenal ulcer. BACKGROUND DATA: Immediate
      acid-reduction surgery has been strongly advocated for perforated duodenal ulcers
      because of the high incidence of ulcer relapse after simple patch repair.
      Although H. pylori eradication is now the standard treatment of uncomplicated and
      bleeding peptic ulcers, its role in perforation remains controversial. Recently a
      high prevalence of H. pylori infection has been reported in patients with
      perforations of duodenal ulcer. It is unclear whether eradication of the
      bacterium confers prolonged ulcer remission after simple repair and hence
      obviates the need for an immediate definitive operation. METHODS: Of 129 patients
      with perforated duodenal ulcers, 104 (81%) were shown to be infected by H.
      pylori. Ninety-nine H. pylori-positive patients were randomized to receive either
      a course of quadruple anti-helicobacter therapy or a 4-week course of omeprazole 
      alone. Follow-up endoscopy was performed 8 weeks, 16 weeks (if the ulcer did not 
      heal at 8 weeks), and 1 year after hospital discharge for surveillance of ulcer
      healing and determination of H. pylori status. The endpoints were initial ulcer
      healing and ulcer relapse rate after 1 year. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were
      assigned to the anti-Helicobacter therapy and 48 to omeprazole alone. Nine
      patients did not undergo the first follow-up endoscopy. Of the 90 patients who
      did undergo follow-up endoscopy, 43 of the 44 patients in the anti-Helicobacter
      group and 8 of the 46 in the omeprazole alone group had H. pylori eradicated;
      initial ulcer healing rates were similar in the two groups (82% vs. 87%). After 1
      year, ulcer relapse was significantly less common in patients treated with
      anti-Helicobacter therapy than in those who received omeprazole alone (4.8% vs.
      38.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Eradication of H. pylori prevents ulcer recurrence in
      patients with H. pylori-associated perforated duodenal ulcers. Immediate
      acid-reduction surgery in the presence of generalized peritonitis is unnecessary.

TI  - Intravenous lidocaine in central pain: a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      psychophysical study.
PG  - 564-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of systemic administration of lidocaine on 
      different components of neuropathic central pains by quantitative sensory
      testing. METHODS: The efficacy of systemic lidocaine (5 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes)
      was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and cross-over fashion, on
      both spontaneous ongoing pain and evoked pains (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in 16
      patients with chronic poststroke (n = 6) or spinal cord injury (n = 10) related
      pain. RESULTS: Lidocaine was significantly superior to the placebo (saline) in
      reducing the intensity of spontaneous ongoing pain for up to 45 minutes after the
      injection: 10 of 16 patients (62.5%) receiving lidocaine showed a significant
      reduction in spontaneous pain, whereas only six patients showed this after the
      placebo. Lidocaine also significantly reduced the intensity of brush-induced
      allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia, but was no better than the placebo against
      thermal allodynia and hyperalgesia. In general, the side effects were moderate
      and consisted mainly of lightheadedness (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic lidocaine
      can induce a significant and selective reduction of several components of pain
      caused by CNS injuries. The observed preferential antihyperalgesic and
      antiallodynic effects of this drug suggest a selective central action on the
      mechanisms underlying these evoked pains.

TI  - Long-term effects of outpatient rehabilitation of COPD: A randomized trial.
PG  - 976-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the short- and long-term effects of an outpatient pulmonary
      rehabilitation program for COPD patients on dyspnea, exercise, health-related
      quality of life, and hospitalization rate. SETTING: Secondary-care respiratory
      clinic in Barcelona. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with
      blinding of outcome assessment and follow-up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
      Sixty patients with moderate to severe COPD (age 65 +/- 7 years; FEV(1) 35 +/-
      14%) were recruited. Thirty patients randomized to rehabilitation received 3
      months of outpatient breathing retraining and chest physiotherapy, 3 months of
      daily supervised exercise, and 6 months of weekly supervised breathing exercises.
      Thirty patients randomized to the control group received standard care. RESULTS: 
      We found significant differences between groups in perception of dyspnea (p <
      0.0001), in 6-min walking test distance (p < 0.0001), and in day-to-day dyspnea, 
      fatigue, and emotional function measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire
      (p < 0. 01). The improvements were evident at the third month and continued with 
      somewhat diminished magnitude in the second year of follow-up. The PR group
      experienced a significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in exacerbations, but not the
      number of hospitalizations. The number of patients needed to treat to achieve
      significant benefit in health-related quality of life for a 2-year period was
      approximately three. CONCLUSION: Outpatient rehabilitation programs can achieve
      worthwhile benefits that persist for a period of 2 years.

TI  - Zinc supplementation and stunted infants in Ethiopia: a randomised controlled
      trial.
PG  - 2021-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stunting is highly prevalent in Ethiopia and many other developing
      countries but the reason for it is poorly understood. Zinc is essential for
      growth but diets in such countries often do not contain zinc in sufficient
      quantity or of sufficient bioavailability. Thus zinc deficiency may play a major 
      role in stunting. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the low rate of
      linear growth of apparently healthy breastfed infants in a rural village in
      Ethiopia could be improved by zinc supplementation. METHODS: A randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done on apparently healthy breastfed
      infants aged 6-12 months. 100 non-stunted (length-for-age, Z score < -2) were
      matched for age and sex with 100 randomly selected stunted (> -2) infants.
      Infants, both stunted and non stunted, were matched by sex, age (within 2 months)
      and recumbent length (within 3 cm) for random assignment, to receive a zinc
      supplement (10 mg zinc per day, as zinc sulphate) or placebo, 6 days a week for 6
      months. Anthropometric measurements were taken monthly, data on illness and
      appetite were collected daily, and samples of serum and hair were taken at the
      end of the intervention for the analysis of zinc. FINDINGS: The length of stunted
      infants increased significantly more (p<0.001) when supplemented with zinc (7.0
      cm [SE 1.1]) than with placebo (2.8 cm [0.9]); and the effect was greater
      (p<0.01) than in non-stunted infants (6.6 [0.9] vs 5.0 [0.8] cm for the zinc and 
      placebo groups respectively, p<0.01). Zinc supplementation also increased the
      weight of stunted children (1.73 [0.39] vs 0.95 [0.39] kg for the corresponding
      placebo group, p<0.001) and of non-stunted children (1.19 [0.39] vs 1.02 [0.32]
      kg for the corresponding placebo group, p<0.05). Zinc supplementation resulted in
      a markedly lower incidence of anorexia and morbidity from cough, diarrhoea,
      fever, and vomiting in the stunted children. The total number of these conditions
      per child was 1.56 and 1.11 in the stunted and non-stunted zinc supplemented
      children versus 3.38 and 1.64 in the stunted and non-stunted placebo-treated
      children, respectively. At the end of the intervention period, the concentrations
      of zinc in serum and hair of stunted infants, who had not been supplemented with 
      zinc, were lower than the respective concentrations of zinc in serum and hair of 
      their non-stunted counterparts. INTERPRETATION: Combating zinc deficiency can
      increase the growth rate of stunted children to that of non-stunted infants in
      rural Ethiopia. This would appear to be due, at least in part, to reduction in
      morbidity from infection and increased appetite.

TI  - Effective prevention of atrial fibrillation by continuous atrial overdrive pacing
      after coronary artery bypass surgery.
PG  - 1411-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a specific
      algorithm with continuous atrial dynamic overdrive pacing to prevent atrial
      fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. BACKGROUND: 
      Atrial fibrillation occurs in 30% to 40% of patients after cardiac surgery with a
      peak incidence on the second day. It still represents a challenge for
      postoperative prevention and treatment and may have medical and cost
      implications. METHODS: Ninety-six consecutive patients undergoing CABG for severe
      coronary artery disease and in sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic therapy on the
      second postoperative day were randomized to have or not 24 h of atrial pacing
      through temporary epicardial wires using a permanent dynamic overdrive algorithm.
      Holter ECGs recorded the same day in both groups were analyzed to detect AF
      occurrence. RESULTS: No difference was observed in baseline data between the two 
      study groups, particularly for age, male gender, history of AF, ventricular
      function, severity of coronary artery disease, preoperative beta-adrenergic
      blocking agent therapy or P-wave duration. The incidence of AF was significantly 
      lower (p = 0.036) in the paced group (10%) compared with control subjects (27%). 
      Multivariate analysis showed AF incidence to increase with age (p = 0.051) but
      not in patients with pacing (p = 0.078). It decreased with a better left
      ventricular ejection fraction only in conjunction with atrial pacing (p = 0.018).
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that continuous atrial pacing with an algorithm for
      dynamic overdrive reduces significantly incidence of AF the second day after CABG
      surgery, particularly in patients with preserved left ventricular function.

TI  - Pemoline treatment of adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: 
      a short-term controlled trial.
PG  - 205-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the increased recognition of attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) in adolescents, few controlled studies have assessed treatments
      for this age group. Adolescent issues, such as embarrassment at receiving
      medication at school and experimentation with abusable substances, have
      accelerated efforts to find effective, well-tolerated treatments beyond
      traditional stimulants. Pemoline has been found effective for treating both
      children and adults with ADHD but has not been evaluated in adolescents with
      ADHD. METHODS: Twenty-one adolescents (mean age 14 years old) diagnosed with ADHD
      by structured and clinical interviews participated in a 10-week, double-blind
      crossover design study of pemoline. Dosing was optimized with robust doses up to 
      3 mg/kg/day in one to two doses. Clinical evaluations of ADHD, depression,
      anxiety, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms were assessed weekly.
      RESULTS: Adolescents with ADHD exhibited a marked response to pemoline treatment 
      relative to placebo on the ADHD rating scale (p = 0.001), with an average
      reduction of 3.02 points per week of treatment. Sixty percent of adolescents
      responded to pemoline, compared to 11% treated with placebo. This response was
      independent of gender or lifetime psychiatric comorbidity. Pemoline was well
      tolerated, with patients averaging 2.88 mg/kg/day in two doses per day, with a
      mean dose at end of follow-up of 181.1 mg (SD 45.6, range 112.5-262.5 mg). Side
      effects were mild, and no adverse hepatic events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings resemble those reported in children and adults with ADHD. This trial
      suggests pemoline is well tolerated and effective in adolescents and may be a
      particularly useful ADHD treatment for adolescents.

TI  - Autoclaved Leishmania major vaccine for prevention of visceral leishmaniasis: a
      randomised, double-blind, BCG-controlled trial in Sudan.
PG  - 1565-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
      the Sudan. Drug treatment is expensive, and drug resistance is becoming
      increasingly common. Safe, effective, and cheap vaccines are needed. We report
      the results of a vaccine trial against human visceral leishmaniasis. METHODS: We 
      undertook a double-blind randomised trial to test the safety and efficacy of an
      autoclaved Leishmania major (ALM) promastigote vaccine (1 mg per dose). Of 5093
      volunteers screened, 2306 had negative leishmanin skin tests and reciprocal
      titres of less than 6400 in the direct agglutination test. They were randomly
      assigned two doses of ALM mixed with BCG or BCG alone. Volunteers were followed
      up for 2 years. The primary endpoint was clinical visceral leishmaniasis or
      post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Analyses were by intention to treat.
      FINDINGS: Side-effects were confined to the injection site. The cumulative
      frequency of visceral leishmaniasis at 2 years did not differ significantly
      between the group assigned ALM plus BCG and that assigned BCG alone (133/1155
      [11.5%] vs 141/1151 [12.3%], p=0.6). The vaccine efficacy was 6% (95% CI -18 to
      25). The proportion of individuals showing leishmanin skin conversion was
      significantly higher in the ALM plus BCG group than in the BCG alone group
      throughout follow-up (303 [30%] vs 72 [7%] at 42 days). Individuals whose
      leishmanin test converted after vaccination (induration > or =5 mm) had a
      significantly lower frequency of visceral leishmaniasis than non-responders
      (27/375 [7.2%] vs 210/1660 [12.7%], p=0.003). INTERPRETATION: We found no
      evidence that two doses of ALM plus BCG offered significant protective immunity
      against visceral leishmaniasis compared with BCG alone. Leishmanin skin
      conversion with an induration of 5 mm or more in either group was associated with
      protection from the disease.

TI  - The World Health Organization oral rehydration solution in US pediatric practice:
      a randomized trial to evaluate parent satisfaction.
PG  - 700-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization's effective, inexpensive oral
      rehydration solution (WHO-ORS) is used worldwide, but rarely by US practitioners 
      because, in part, of concerns about parent satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: To compare
      caretaker satisfaction with the WHO-ORS, a packet-based solution requiring
      preparation, with satisfaction with a commercially prepared oral rehydration
      solution (C-ORS), (Pedialyte; Ross Nutritionals, Columbus, Ohio). DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trial in an urban pediatric clinic and a suburban 
      family medicine clinic. Children aged 3 to 47 months treated as outpatients for
      diarrhea were randomized to receive either WHO-ORS or C-ORS. After 48 hours of
      use, caretakers completed a telephone interview measuring satisfaction with
      aspects of the solution. RESULTS: Of 97 families enrolled, 91 (94%) were
      available for follow-up interviews. The WHO-ORS and C-ORS groups were comparable 
      at baseline in all respects, except that slightly more caretakers in the latter
      group had used the C-ORS for the current illness before study enrollment (P=
      .06). Caretakers in the WHO-ORS group had higher overall satisfaction,
      satisfaction with cost, willingness to purchase in the future, and to recommend
      use (P<.001 for all). Differences remained significant after controlling for
      prior use of the C-ORS. There was no difference in satisfaction with ease of
      administration (P=.90), appearance (P=.20), and effectiveness (P=.80). No adverse
      effects attributable to either study solution occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Caretakers
      who prepared and used the WHO-ORS were more satisfied with their solution than a 
      comparable group who administered C-ORS. Fear of parental dissatisfaction need
      not be a barrier to use of the WHO-ORS in the United States.

TI  - Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity of rofecoxib and naproxen in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis. VIGOR Study Group.
PG  - 1520-8, 2 p following 1528
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year, clinical upper gastrointestinal events occur in 2 to 4
      percent of patients who are taking nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed whether rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase-2, would be associated with a lower incidence of clinically
      important upper gastrointestinal events than is the nonselective NSAID naproxen
      among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We randomly assigned 8076
      patients who were at least 50 years of age (or at least 40 years of age and
      receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy) and who had rheumatoid arthritis to
      receive either 50 mg of rofecoxib daily or 500 mg of naproxen twice daily. The
      primary end point was confirmed clinical upper gastrointestinal events
      (gastroduodenal perforation or obstruction, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
      symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers). RESULTS: Rofecoxib and naproxen had similar
      efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. During a median follow-up of 9.0 months,
      2.1 confirmed gastrointestinal events per 100 patient-years occurred with
      rofecoxib, as compared with 4.5 per 100 patient-years with naproxen (relative
      risk, 0.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 0.6; P<0.001). The respective
      rates of complicated confirmed events (perforation, obstruction, and severe upper
      gastrointestinal bleeding) were 0.6 per 100 patient-years and 1.4 per 100
      patient-years (relative risk, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8;
      P=0.005). The incidence of myocardial infarction was lower among patients in the 
      naproxen group than among those in the rofecoxib group (0.1 percent vs. 0.4
      percent; relative risk, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.7); the
      overall mortality rate and the rate of death from cardiovascular causes were
      similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis,
      treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is
      associated with significantly fewer clinically important upper gastrointestinal
      events than treatment with naproxen, a nonselective inhibitor.

TI  - Effects of a heat and moisture exchanger and a heated humidifier on respiratory
      mucus in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.
PG  - 312-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a heat and moisture exchanger and a heated 
      humidifier on respiratory mucus and transportability by cilia and cough in
      patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (up to 72 hrs). DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, clinical study. SETTING: General intensive care unit and
      university research laboratory. PATIENTS: A total of 32 consecutive patients with
      acute respiratory failure, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated in the 
      intensive care unit setting, were enrolled in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients 
      were randomly assigned to receive as a humidifying system a heat and moisture
      exchanger (HME) or heated humidified water (HHW) at the onset of mechanical
      ventilation (time 0). Respiratory mucus samples were collected by suction using a
      sterile technique at time 0, 24, 48, and 72 hrs of mechanical ventilation.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eleven patients were excluded from this study
      because of either extubation or death before 72 hrs of mechanical ventilation,
      leaving 12 patients in the HME group and nine patients in the HHW group.
      Ventilatory variables including minute volume, mean airway pressure, positive
      end-expiratory pressure, Fio2, as well as Pao2/Fio2 ratio, fluid balance (last 6 
      hrs), furosemide, and inotrope administration (last 4 hrs) were recorded. In
      vitro mucus transportability by cilia was evaluated on the mucus-depleted frog
      palate model, and the results were expressed as the mucus transport rate. Cough
      clearance (an estimation of the interaction between the flow of air and the mucus
      lining the bronchial walls) was measured using a simulated cough machine, the
      results being expressed in millimeters. Mucus wettability was measured by the
      contact angle between a mucus sample drop and a flat glass surface. Mucus
      rheologic properties (mechanical impedance [log G*] and the ratio between
      viscosity and elasticity [tan delta]) were measured using a magnetic
      microrheometer at 1 and 100 cGy/sec deformation frequency. The two humidification
      groups were comparable in terms of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
      Evaluation II score, age, gender, ventilatory variables, fluid balance, use of
      inotropes, and furosemide. CONCLUSION: Ours results indicate that air
      humidification with either HME or HHW at 32 degrees C (89.6 degrees F) has
      similar effects on mucus rheologic properties, contact angle, and
      transportability by cilia in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, except
      for transportability by cough, which diminished after 72 hrs of mechanical
      ventilation in the HME group (p = .0441).

TI  - Outcome of patients with congestive heart failure treated with standard versus
      high doses of enalapril: a multicenter study. High Enalapril Dose Study Group.
PG  - 2090-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to prospectively and randomly compare survival with
      clinical and hemodynamic variables in patients with congestive heart failure
      (CHF) treated with standard versus high doses of enalapril. BACKGROUND:
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors produce hemodynamic and
      symptomatic benefits in patients with CHF, but there is still controversy about
      the optimal dose in this clinical setting. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-eight
      patients with advanced CHF (age 56.3+/-12 years) were randomized to receive a
      maximal tolerated dose of enalapril, up to 20 mg/day in group 1 (mean dose
      achieved 17.9+/-4.3 mg/day, n = 122) and 60 mg/day in group 2 (mean dose achieved
      42+/-19.3 mg/day, n = 126). RESULTS: At enrollment, patients in group 1 were in
      New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 2.6+/-0.7 and had a mean
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 117+/-18 mm Hg, a mean heart rate (HR) of
      85+/-16 beats/min and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20.0+/-9.8%.
      In group 2, patients were in NYHA class 2.6+/-0.7; their SBP was 118+/-17 mm Hg, 
      HR 83+/-15 beats/min and LVEF 18.8+/-8.1%. There were no significant differences 
      in these characteristics between the two groups of patients at enrollment. After 
      12 months of follow-up, 22 (18%) of 122 patients in group 1 and 23 (18%) of 126
      patients in group 2 had died (p = 0.995, with 80% power of the study to detect a 
      delta difference of 13%). The NYHA class was the same (1.9+/-0.7) in both groups;
      SBP was 111+/-16 and 111+/-17 mm Hg, HR 77+/-12 and 79+/-13 beats/min and LVEF
      31+/-19% and 30+/-12% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. These differences were not
      statistically significant. The study had a power of 80% to detect (p = 0.05) the 
      following changes: 13% in death rate, 0.25 units in NYHA class, 6 mm Hg in SBP, 5
      beats/min in HR and 6% in LVEF. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were
      found in survival and clinical and hemodynamic variables between patients
      receiving standard and those receiving high doses of enalapril.

TI  - A randomized trial of itraconazole in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
PG  - 756-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a hypersensitivity
      disorder that can progress from an acute phase to chronic disease. The main
      treatment is systemic corticosteroids, but data from uncontrolled studies suggest
      that itraconazole, an orally administered antifungal agent, may be an effective
      adjunctive therapy. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of
      treatment with either 200 mg of itraconazole twice daily or placebo for 16 weeks 
      in patients who met immunologic and pulmonary-function criteria for
      corticosteroid-dependent allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. A response was 
      defined as a reduction of at least 50 percent in the corticosteroid dose, a
      decrease of at least 25 percent in the serum IgE concentration, and one of the
      following: an improvement of at least 25 percent in exercise tolerance or
      pulmonary-function tests or resolution or absence of pulmonary infiltrates. In a 
      second, open-label part of the trial, all the patients received 200 mg of
      itraconazole per day for 16 weeks. RESULTS: There were responses in 13 of 28
      patients in the itraconazole group (46 percent), as compared with 5 of 27
      patients in the placebo group (19 percent, P=0.04). The rate of adverse events
      was similar in the two groups. In the subsequent open-label phase, 12 of the 33
      patients who had not had a response during the double-blind phase (36 percent)
      had responses, and none of the patients who had a response in the double-blind
      phase of the trial had a relapse. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with
      corticosteroid-dependent allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, the addition of
      itraconazole can lead to improvement in the condition without added toxicity.

TI  - Effect of acute stroke unit care integrated with care continuum versus
      conventional treatment: A randomized 1-year study of elderly patients: the
      Goteborg 70+ Stroke Study.
PG  - 2578-84
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of
      conventional treatment with the effect of acute stroke unit care integrated with 
      geriatric stroke unit care continuum. METHODS: A 1-year study was undertaken with
      2:1 randomization to stroke unit care or conventional care, with assessment by an
      independent team. The study was composed of 249 elderly patients (aged >/=70
      years) hospitalized for acute stroke, without previous cerebral lesion and
      without recognized need of care. Main outcome measures were patients at home
      after 1 year, ability in daily living activities, health-related quality of life 
      score according to questionnaire, death or institutional care, and death or
      dependence. RESULTS: One hundred two patients (61%) in the stroke unit and 49
      patients (59%) in the general ward group were alive and at home after 1 year (95%
      CI -10% to 16%). There were no significant differences in daily life activities
      or quality of life. In patients with concomitant cardiac disease, there was a
      reduction in death or institutional care after 3 months in the stroke unit group 
      compared with the group receiving conventional care (28% versus 49%,
      respectively; 95% CI -40% to -3%). This effect did not remain after 1 year.
      Patients seeking care after 24 hours often had mild stroke and lived alone.
      CONCLUSIONS: There was no effect on the number of patients living at home after 1
      year, but after 3 months of stroke unit care, a beneficial effect was found on
      mortality and the need for institutional care among those with concomitant heart 
      disease. This study involved patients who were considerably older than those
      investigated in previous randomized studies of acute stroke unit care; thus,
      these findings will contribute to the specialized register of controlled trials
      in stroke.

TI  - Efficacy of omeprazole for the treatment of symptomatic acid reflux disease
      without esophagitis.
PG  - 1810-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to three quarters of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) have symptoms, such as heartburn, but no macroscopic evidence of erosive
      esophagitis, making symptomatic GERD a common clinical problem in the primary
      care setting. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of omeprazole, 20 mg 
      once daily; omeprazole, 10 mg once daily; and placebo in the treatment of
      symptomatic GERD without erosive esophagitis. METHODS: Patients with a history of
      heartburn (> or =12 months) and episodes of moderate to severe heartburn on 4 or 
      more of the 7 days before endoscopy were eligible to participate in this 4-week, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The absence of erosive
      esophagitis was established through endoscopy. Eligible patients were randomized 
      to 1 of 3 treatment groups: omeprazole, 20 mg once daily; omeprazole, 10 mg once 
      daily; or placebo. Patients were assessed at weeks 2 and 4. The efficacy of
      omeprazole for the treatment of heartburn was determined mainly through the
      following diary card data: daily resolution of heartburn and complete resolution 
      of heartburn every day during 1 week of treatment. The efficacy of omeprazole for
      the treatment of acid regurgitation, dysphagia, epigastric pain, and nausea was
      also assessed. RESULTS: Of 359 randomized patients, 355 were included in the
      statistical analysis (intention-to-treat population). Daily proportions of
      patients with no heartburn were consistently greater in the 20-mg omeprazole
      group (62%, day 7; 74%, day 27) than in the 10-mg omeprazole group (41%, day 7;
      49%, day 27) or the placebo group (14%, day 7; 23%; day 27). Complete resolution 
      of heartburn every day during the last treatment week was significantly (P< or
      =.002) higher in the 20-mg omeprazole group (48%) than in the 10-mg omeprazole
      (27%) or placebo (5%) group. Omeprazole was significantly (P< or =.003) more
      effective than placebo for the treatment of acid regurgitation, dysphagia,
      epigastric pain, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with symptomatic GERD require 
      profound acid suppression to achieve symptomatic relief. Omeprazole, 20 mg once
      daily, was superior to omeprazole, 10 mg once daily, and to placebo in providing 
      early and sustained resolution of heartburn, as well as treatment of other
      troublesome GERD symptoms.

      and the axilla, and making patients eligible for less invasive surgical
      procedures. The usefulness of IC in earlier stage operable breast carcinoma is
      now being considered. METHODS: This study involved a subset of 129 patients from 
      a series of 174 with T2-3, N0-1, M0 or T1, N1, M0 breast carcinoma (Stage IIA,
      IIB, or IIIA ) who were registered in a prospective IC trial using paclitaxel or 
      a combination of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC). The
      subset included patients who had received no preoperative radiation therapy but
      had completed 3-5 cycles of induction chemotherapy and had undergone a Level I-II
      axillary lymph node dissection. The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness
      of induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel or FAC in downstaging the primary tumor
      and axillary metastases in these early stage breast carcinoma patients. RESULTS: 
      The median initial tumor size was 4 cm (range, 0.6-10.0); after IC, tumor size
      was downstaged to 1.6 cm (range, 0.0-7.0) (P < 0.0001). Clinical response to IC
      was complete in 24% of patients and partial in 36%. Primary tumor shrinkage was
      similar with paclitaxel and FAC. Among patients clinically classified as N1, 34% 
      became histologically negative and 38% had only 1-3 positive lymph nodes after
      induction chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: IC with paclitaxel or FAC resulted in
      effective downstaging of primary tumors and axillary metastases in patients with 
      Stage IIA, IIB, and IIIA breast carcinoma. However, a significant proportion of
      patients still had residual but low volume microscopic disease; such disease
      status may allow minimally invasive surgical approaches to locoregional therapy.

TI  - Polymeric versus elemental diet as primary treatment in active Crohn's disease: a
      randomized, double-blind trial.
PG  - 735-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enteral feeding is now an established primary therapy for active
      Crohn's disease. This first-double blind randomized trial was designed to compare
      the therapeutic efficacy of a polymeric diet (PD) with an elemental diet (ED).
      METHODS: Patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's disease activity index
      [CDAI] > 150, increased bowel uptake of Tc-HMPAO-labeled leukocytes, and abnormal
      C-reactive protein [CRP]), were randomized to receive either an ED or a PD. The
      two preparations were identical except for the nitrogen source, which was amino
      acid based in ED and intact protein in PD. Enteral feeding was considered
      successful if clinical remission was achieved as defined by a final CDAI of < or 
      = 150, a reduction in the CDAI by at least 100 points from baseline level, and a 
      normal CRP. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled of whom 11 were randomized
      to PD and 10 to ED. The two groups were comparable at entry. Clinical remission
      was obtained in eight (80%) patients receiving ED and six (55%) patients
      receiving PD, p = 0.1. The treatment failed in three and two patients in the PD
      and ED groups, respectively. Another two patients were intolerant to the feed
      (PD). Reduction in the CDAI after treatment with ED (359 +/- 67 to 112 +/- 19)
      was similar to that seen with PD (303 +/- 27 to 97 +/- 11). Similar changes in
      the CRP were also observed (16 +/- 5 to 4 +/- 1.6) and (62 +/- 20 to 9 +/- 6),
      respectively. Overall, enteral feeding was successful in 14 patients (63%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Enteral nutrition is effective in treatment of active Crohn's
      disease. Differences in nitrogen sources of enteral feeds are not relevant to
      their therapeutic efficacy, as polymeric and elemental diets are equally
      effective.

TI  - Effect of combined fluvastatin-fenofibrate therapy compared with fenofibrate
      monotherapy in severe primary hypercholesterolemia. French Fluvastatin Study
      Group.
PG  - 53-7
AB  - This double-blind study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of
      fluvastatin-fenofibrate combination therapy compared with fenofibrate monotherapy
      in severe primary hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol
      > or =190 mg/dl [4.9 mmol/L], triglycerides < or =350mg/dl [3.9 mmol/l]). After a
      10-week placebo and dietary baseline period, 102 patients were randomized to
      receive micronized fenofibrate 200 mg, fluvastatin 20 mg plus micronized
      fenofibrate 200 mg, or fluvastatin 40 mg plus micronized fenofibrate 200 mg. At
      week 16, fenofibrate 200 mg alone lowered LDL cholesterol from baseline by 21%
      compared with 32% for fluvastatin 20 mg plus fenofibrate 200 mg and 41% for
      fluvastatin 40 mg plus fenofibrate 200 mg (p <0.001). Triglycerides decreased by 
      29% with fenofibrate 200 mg alone, 39% with fluvastatin 20 mg plus fenofibrate
      200 mg, and 40% with fluvastatin 40 mg plus fenofibrate 200 mg (p <0.05). Safety 
      was assessed by recording adverse events and measuring clinical laboratory
      parameters. The adverse event profile was similar for the 3 treatment groups. One
      patient withdrew due to an increase in transaminase levels. No significant
      increase in creatine phosphokinase levels was observed with combination therapy. 
      In conclusion, the addition of fluvastatin to micronized fenofibrate results in
      substantial improvement in atherogenic plasma lipids and is well tolerated.

TI  - Long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcome of percutaneous mitral
      valvuloplasty: randomized comparison of Inoue and double-balloon techniques.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to compare the long-term
      clinical and echocardiographic results of the Inoue and the double-balloon
      techniques. BACKGROUND: The large randomized trial comparing the extent of
      commissurotomy and the long-term results between the double-balloon and Inoue
      balloon techniques has not been reported. METHODS: We conducted a prospective,
      randomized trial comparing two procedures in 302 consecutive patients who
      underwent percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty (PMV) using Inoue (n = 152; group I) 
      or double-balloon technique (n = 150, group D) between 1989 and 1995. The sample 
      size was planned to provide the study with approximately 80% power for the
      detection of a 10% difference between the two groups. RESULTS: There were no
      significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups.
      Immediately after PMV, mitral valve area (MVA) increased from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 1.8 
      +/- 0.3 cm2 in group I and from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 1.9 +/- 0.3 cm2 in group D. No
      significant differences existed between the two groups in terms of development of
      commissural splitting, commissural mitral regurgitation (CMR), moderate to severe
      mitral regurgitation (MR) and MVA after PMV. The successful immediate results
      (MVA > or =1.5 cm2 and MR < or =2) were achieved in 127 (84%) patients of group I
      and 122 (81%) patients of group D (p = NS). Annual clinical and echocardiographic
      evaluation was completed for 290 (96%) patients with mean follow-up of 51 +/- 27 
      months. Adverse events occurred in 19 (13%) patients of group I (3 deaths, 7
      mitral valve replacements, 5 repeat PMV, 2 NYHA class > or =3, 2 technical
      failures) and 16 (11%) patients of group D (2 deaths, 10 mitral valve
      replacements, 3 repeat PMV, 1 NYHA class > or =3). Estimated actuarial seven-year
      event-free survival was 75 +/- 7% in group I and 82 +/- 6% in group D (p = NS).
      Estimated actuarial seven-year restenosis-free survival was 67 +/- 7% in group I 
      and 76 +/- 6% in group D (p = NS). On multivariate analysis, unsuccessful
      immediate result (p < 0.001) and absence of CMR (p < 0.01) were independently
      related with events. Absence of CMR and smaller mitral valve area after PMV were 
      independently related with restenosis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Inoue and
      double-balloon techniques were equally effective in commissurotomy and produced
      similar, excellent long-term results. The achievement of complete commissurotomy 
      with development of CMR or larger post-PMV mitral valve area is important to
      optimize the long-term results of PMV.

TI  - Randomized clinical trial of micronized flavonoids in the early control of
      bleeding from acute internal haemorrhoids.
PG  - 868-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with acute bleeding from internal haemorrhoids often have to
      be referred by the general practitioner to the surgeon for definitive treatment
      with invasive outpatient procedures. At the initial consultation, patients
      frequently seek postponement of immediate surgery to a more convenient time.
      Effective and rapid non-invasive control of acute bleeding could be of practical 
      use in scheduling surgery to a time convenient to both patient and surgeon.
      METHODS: In a 90-day randomized, double-blind study treatment with a micronized
      purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) was compared with placebo, in 100 outpatients 
      who presented for treatment of acute internal haemorrhoids of less than 3 days'
      duration. The primary endpoint was cessation of bleeding on the third day of
      treatment. RESULTS: Of 50 patients randomized to each group, acute bleeding
      ceased by the third day in 40 (80 per cent) who received MPFF compared with 19
      (38 per cent) who had placebo (P < 0.01). Mean(s.d. ) duration of acute bleeding 
      from onset to cessation of 4.9(1.6) days was 2.1 (95 per cent confidence interval
      1.2-2.9) days less than that in patients receiving placebo (P < 0.01). Continued 
      treatment in patients with no bleeding prevented a relapse in 30 of 47 patients, 
      compared with 12 of 30 receiving placebo (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with
      acute internal haemorrhoids treated with MPFF had rapid cessation of bleeding and
      a reduced risk of relapse. This could be of value in the more convenient timing
      of treatment with invasive outpatient procedures.

TI  - Effects of pravastatin in 3260 patients with unstable angina: results from the
      LIPID study.
PG  - 1871-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The LIPID study is a major trial of secondary prevention of
      coronary-heart-disease events that includes hospital admission with unstable
      angina (as well as myocardial infarction) as a qualifying event. In this substudy
      of LIPID, we compared subsequent cardiovascular risks and the effects of
      pravastatin in patients with previous unstable angina or previous myocardial
      infarction. METHODS: 3260 patients diagnosed with unstable angina and 5754 with
      acute myocardial infarction 3-36 months previously were randomly assigned 40 mg
      pravastatin daily or placebo over a mean of 6.0 years. The risk reduction of a
      range of cardiovascular events was estimated by means of the hazard ratio in
      Cox's proportional hazards model. FINDINGS: Among patients assigned placebo,
      survival in the two diagnosis groups was similar. The relative risk reduction for
      mortality with pravastatin was 20.6% in the myocardial infarction group and 26.3%
      in the unstable angina group (p=0.55). Pravastatin significantly reduced the
      rates of all prespecified coronary endpoints in the myocardial infarction group. 
      In patients with previous unstable angina, coronary heart disease mortality,
      total mortality, myocardial infarction, a need for coronary revascularisation,
      the number of admissions to hospital, and the number of days in hospital were
      significantly lower with pravastatin. Overall, hospital admission for unstable
      angina was the most common endpoint (24.6% of the placebo group; 22.3% of the
      pravastatin group). INTERPRETATION: Patients who have survived acute myocardial
      infarction or unstable angina have a similar long-term prognosis, a high
      occurrence of subsequent unstable angina, and benefit similarly from therapy with
      pravastatin.

TI  - IV immunoglobulin does not reverse established weakness in MS.
PG  - 1135-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin (Ig) administration induces remyelination in the
      Theiler's virus model of MS. METHODS: A randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial of IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) was performed in patients
      with MS who had persistent muscle weakness that had been stable for between 4 and
      18 months to determine whether this would improve muscle strength (primary
      outcome: isometric muscle strength). Patients received either IVIg (0.4 g/kg) or 
      placebo daily for 5 days, then single infusions every 2 weeks for 3 months
      (total, 11 infusions). Muscle groups identified by clinical measures to have
      unchanging significant weakness were the major targets for therapeutic response
      (targeted neurologic deficit [TND]). RESULTS: IVIg was well tolerated. An interim
      analysis after 67 patients were enrolled indicated no difference in the degree of
      change in strength between treatment groups in either the TND or non-TND muscle
      groups at 6 months, and the trial was terminated. There was no apparent benefit
      in relapse behavior or impairment measures during the 6-month observation period.
      Nor was there apparent benefit in either patients who remained clinically stable 
      or in those with evidence of disease activity. Patients with active MS during the
      trial worsened in both TND and non-TND muscle groups. This worsening was seen
      regardless of whether the clinical manifestations of disease activity involved
      the TND muscle groups. CONCLUSIONS: IVIg does not reverse established weakness in
      MS. Measurements of isometric muscle strength were reliable (reproducible)
      indices of strength and may be sensitive, objective methods to document
      functional changes in impairment in future MS trials.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Adderall and methylphenidate in the
      treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 619-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While Adderall has been available for the treatment of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for several years, there are few 
      controlled studies comparing it to methylphenidate. METHOD: Fifty-eight children 
      with ADHD (mean age 8.1 +/- 1.4 years) were randomly assigned to receive placebo,
      methylphenidate, or Adderall in a double-blind, parallel-group design for 3
      weeks. Dosage was adjusted at the end of weeks 1 and 2 via an algorithm based on 
      teacher and parent ratings. Final doses were 12.5 +/- 4.1 mg/day for Adderall and
      25.2 +/- 13.1 mg/day for methylphenidate. Teacher and parent ratings, as well as 
      the psychiatrist's Clinical Global Impression (CGI), were the final outcome
      measures at the end of week 3. RESULTS: Both medications were superior to placebo
      at reducing inattentive and oppositional symptoms in the classroom and on the
      CGI. Adderall produced significantly more improvements on teacher ratings and the
      CGI than methylphenidate, although the algorithm may have limited dosing in the
      methylphenidate group. Seventy percent of children in the Adderall group were
      given medication once a day, compared with 15% of the subjects receiving
      methylphenidate. CONCLUSIONS: Adderall compared favorably to methylphenidate, and
      the behavioral effects of Adderall appear to persist longer than those of
      methylphenidate after individual doses.

TI  - Post-prandial administration of the insulin analogue insulin aspart in patients
      with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 371-5
AB  - AIMS: In intensified insulin therapy, the recent development of short-acting
      insulin analogues with a very rapid onset of action forces a new discussion in
      terms of the optimal injection-meal interval. This study evaluated prandial
      glycaemia in patients with Type 1 diabetes following the subcutaneous injection
      of soluble human insulin (HI) and the insulin analogue insulin aspart (IAsp) at
      different injection-meal intervals and investigated whether administration of
      IAsp after the meal might provide satisfactory metabolic control. METHODS: In a
      randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, four-period crossover study, 20 Type 1
      diabetic patients were investigated. Prandial insulin was administered 15 min
      before the start of the meal (HI(-15min)), immediately before the meal (HI(0min);
      IAsp(0min)) and 15 min after the start of the meal (IAsp(+15min)). RESULTS:
      Plasma glucose excursions from baseline levels during the 4 h (PGexc) were
      highest with HI(0min) (17.9 mmol.l(-1).h; P < 0.05 vs. other treatments) and were
      not statistically different for HI(-15min), IAsp(0min) and IAsp(15min) (13.6,
      11.9 and 14.2 mmol.l(-1).h, respectively). Maximum concentration of plasma
      glucose (PGmax) was lowest with IAsp(0min) (11.2 mmol/l; P < 0.05 vs. other
      treatments). PGmax was comparable with HI(-15min), HI(0min) and IAsp(+15min)
      (13.3, 14.1 and 13.2 mmol/l, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: With regard to prandial 
      glycaemia IAsp(+15min) is as effective as HI(-5min) and superior to HI(0min).
      Thus, post-prandial dosing of the insulin analogue IAsp offers an attractive and 
      feasible therapeutic option for well-controlled patients with Type 1 diabetes
      mellitus.

TI  - The EWA (estrogen in women with atherosclerosis) study: a randomized study of the
      use of hormone replacement therapy in women with angiographically verified
      coronary artery disease. Characteristics of the study population. Effects on
      lipids and lipoproteins.
PG  - 433-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on
      lipids and lipoproteins in postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease.
      SETTING: In this single-centre, controlled and randomized study taking place in a
      tertiary referral clinic, patients were examined at baseline, and after 3 and 12 
      months. All analyses were performed examiner-blind. SUBJECTS: Postmenopausal
      women (n = 118) with angiographically verified coronary artery disease were
      recruited consecutively from patients referred for investigational procedures due
      to coronary artery disease. INTERVENTIONS: The women were randomized to HRT, i.e.
      transdermal application of continuous 17-beta oestradiol with cyclic
      medroxyprogesterone actetate tablets every 3rd month for 14 days, or to a control
      group. MAIN OUTCOMES: Effects on lipids and lipoproteins. RESULTS: After 3 months
      of unopposed oestradiol, triglycerides decreased significantly compared to the
      control group (P = 0.006). Sequential administration of medroxyprogesterone
      caused a decrease in HDL cholesterol (P = 0.01), concomitantly with a decrease in
      ApoA1 lipoproteins (P = 0.007). No other changes in lipids or lipoproteins were
      observed. After 12 months of therapy, no significant differences were observed
      between the two groups in lipid or lipoprotein levels. Concomitant statin
      treatment did not alter the main findings. CONCLUSIONS: In postmenopausal women
      with established coronary artery disease in whom the majority is treated with
      statins, no additional effect of HRT on lipids or lipoproteins could be observed 
      except for a transient decrease in triglycerides in the initial unopposed
      oestradiol phase. No deleterious effect could be observed during
      medroxyprogesterone administration except for a small transient decrease in HDL
      cholesterol and ApoA1 lipoproteins.

TI  - Ventilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with traditional tidal volumes
      for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
PG  - 1301-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of
      10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight and may cause stretch-induced lung injury
      in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
      We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal 
      volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Patients 
      with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled 
      in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation
      treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of
      predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at
      the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with
      ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 
      6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of
      water or less. The primary outcomes were death before a patient was discharged
      home and was breathing without assistance and the number of days without
      ventilator use from day 1 to day 28. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after the
      enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with 
      lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes
      (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without
      ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this
      group (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-11 vs. 10+/-11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on
      days 1 to 3 were 6.2+/-0.8 and 11.8+/-0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body
      weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25+/-6 and
      33+/-8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute
      lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation
      with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased
      mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.

TI  - Prelabor rupture of the membranes at term: expectant management at home or in
      hospital? The TermPROM Study Group.
PG  - 533-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adverse effects of expectant management for
      premature rupture of membranes (PROM) at term and patient satisfaction were
      greater if women were managed at home rather than in a hospital. METHODS: We
      undertook a secondary analysis of data from the International TermPROM Study for 
      women managed expectantly at home or in a hospital. Using multiple logistic
      regression analyses, we determined the effect of home and hospital management and
      controlled for differences in baseline characteristics, in measures of maternal
      and neonatal infections and rates of cesarean. RESULTS: Six hundred fifty-three
      women (39.1%) were managed at home, and 1017 (60.9%) in a hospital. Management at
      home, compared with in a hospital, increased risk of nulliparas needing
      antibiotics before delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.52 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.04, 2.24, P =.03), those not colonized with group B streptococcus having
      cesareans (OR 1.48 95% CI 1.03, 2. 14, P =.04), and neonatal infections (OR 1.97 
      95% CI 1.00, 3.90, P =. 05). More multiparas managed at home said they would
      participate in the study again (OR 1.80 95% CI 1.27, 2.54, P <.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Expectant management at home, rather than in a hospital, might increase the
      likelihood of some adverse outcomes.

TI  - Electromagnetic versus fluoroscopic mapping of the inferior isthmus for ablation 
      of typical atrial flutter: A prospective randomized study.
PG  - 2082-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation within the tricuspid
      annulus-inferior caval vein isthmus can cure typical atrial flutter. The target
      for ablation, nonetheless, is relatively wide, and standard ablation procedures
      may require significant exposure to radiation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 50
      patients (mean age, 58+/-11 years) with typical atrial flutter were prospectively
      randomized to receive isthmus ablation using conventional fluoroscopy for
      catheter navigation (group I, n=24) or electromagnetic mapping (group II, n=26). 
      Complete bidirectional isthmus block was verified with double potential mapping. 
      If complete isthmus block could not be achieved after 20 radiofrequency pulses or
      25 minutes of fluoroscopy, the patients were switched to the other group. Eight
      patients from group I (33%) but only 1 patient from group II (4%) were switched. 
      Overall, complete isthmus block was achieved in 47 of 50 patients (94%). The
      overall fluoroscopy time, including the placement of the diagnostic catheters,
      was 22.0+/-6.3 minutes in group I and 3.9+/-1.5 minutes in group II (P:<0.0001). 
      The fluoroscopy time needed for isthmus mapping was 17.7+/-6.5 minutes in group I
      and 0.2+/-0.3 minutes in group II (P:<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Electromagnetic
      mapping during the induction of linear lesions for the ablation of atrial flutter
      permitted a highly significant reduction in exposure to fluoroscopy while
      maintaining high efficacy, and it allowed the time required for fluoroscopy to be
      reduced to levels anticipated for diagnostic electrophysiological studies.

TI  - Enhanced efficacy of eptifibatide administration in patients with acute coronary 
      syndrome requiring in-hospital coronary artery bypass grafting. PURSUIT
      Investigators.
PG  - 2952-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with a recent episode of non-ST-segment elevation acute
      coronary syndrome before CABG have higher rates of operative morbidity and
      mortality than patients with stable coronary syndromes. The efficacy of
      administering eptifibatide to these patients undergoing in-hospital CABG is
      unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Platelet Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa in Unstable
      Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy (PURSUIT) trial randomized 
      10 948 patients to receive either eptifibatide or placebo. There were 1558 study 
      participants who underwent in-hospital CABG: 692 received placebo, and 866
      received eptifibatide. The main substudy analysis end point was death or
      myocardial infarction (MI) rates at the 6-month follow-up. The 30-day death or MI
      rates were 30. 8% and 26.1% for the placebo and eptifibatide groups, respectively
      (P:=0.041). The benefit of eptifibatide administration persisted through 6-months
      of follow-up (32.7% versus 27.6% for placebo versus eptifibatide, respectively;
      P:=0.029). There was a greater reduction in the 6-month death or MI rate for
      patients who received eptifibatide within 72 hours of CABG (33.6% versus 23.8%;
      P:=0.002) compared with the >72-hour group (31.6% versus 32%; P:=1.0). The
      incidence of major bleeding was 56.6% for placebo-treated patients versus 58.2%
      for eptifibatide-treated patients (P:=0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Eptifibatide
      administration in patients undergoing in-hospital CABG with a recent episode of a
      non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome results in a significant
      reduction in death or MI that is evident at 7 days and persists through the
      6-month follow-up without a significant increase in perioperative bleeding rates.

TI  - Exogenous surfactant supplementation in infants with respiratory syncytial virus 
      bronchiolitis.
PG  - 1251-6
AB  - Infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis are deficient in
      surfactant, both in quantity and ability to reduce surface tension. New evidence 
      suggests surfactant has a role in maintaining the patency of conducting airways, 
      which has implications for RSV bronchiolitis. A randomized, controlled pilot
      study was undertaken to assess the effects of exogenous surfactant
      supplementation to RSV-positive infants on pulmonary mechanics, indices of gas
      exchange, and the phospholipid composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
      (BALF). Nineteen ventilated infants (median corrected age 4 wk) received either
      two doses of surfactant (Survanta, 100 mg/kg) within 24 and 48 h of mechanical
      ventilation (n = 9), or air placebo (n = 10). Static lung compliance and
      resistance of infants in the placebo but not in the surfactant-treated group
      became progressively worse over the first 30 h following enrollment. Although no 
      significant acute changes in gas exchange parameters were seen following
      surfactant, infants in the surfactant group showed a more rapid improvement in
      oxygenation and ventilation indices over the first 60 h of ventilation.
      Surfactant status was assessed from the concentration ratio in BALF of the
      disaturated phospholipid species dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine to that of the
      monounsaturated species palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine. This ratio correlated
      with both lung compliance (positively) and resistance (negatively), and over time
      increased in the treated group and declined in placebo infants. The data from
      this pilot study suggest that functional surfactant has a role in maintaining
      small airway patency as well as lung compliance in infants infected with RSV and 
      an outcome study is now warranted.

TI  - The effect of nondirective questioning on women's decisions whether to undergo
      bone density screening: an experimental study.
PG  - 181-91
AB  - This study investigated the effects of nondirective counseling on health
      screening decisions. Ninety women (mean age = 51 years) received information
      about bone density screening and osteoporosis. They were then randomly allocated 
      to 1 of 4 groups and were encouraged to focus on positive issues about bone
      density screening (positive group), on negative issues (negative group), on both 
      positive and negative issues (all-focusing group), or on issues relating to the
      common cold (control group). Women were asked to rate how likely they would be to
      opt for bone density screening if they saw it available. After being informed
      that they could have bone density screening, actual uptake was assessed. It was
      found that the issues on which individuals focused significantly influenced their
      rate likelihood of opting for the scan. Rated likelihood of testing was
      significantly associated with whether individuals actually did opt for testing
      when it was subsequently offered to them.

TI  - Recombinant human growth hormone treatment in pediatric burn patients and its
      role during the hepatic acute phase response.
PG  - 1578-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) has been shown to increase
      mortality in adult trauma patients; however, little has been reported on its side
      effects in children. The acute phase response has been suggested to be a
      contributing factor to trauma mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
      to examine the effects of exogenous rHGH on the acute phase response in pediatric
      bum patients. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind study. SETTING:
      Shriners Hospital for Children. PATIENTS: Thermally injured pediatric patients,
      ranging in age from 0.1 to 16 yrs. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-eight thermally injured 
      children received either 0.2 mg/kg/day of rHGH or saline (placebo) within 3 days 
      of admission and for at least 25 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
      Measurements were patient demographics, incidence of sepsis, inhalation injury,
      mortality, serum constitutive proteins, acute phase proteins, proinflammatory
      cytokines and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor
      binding protein (IGFBP)-1, and IGFBP-3. No differences could be demonstrated in
      age, gender, burn size, incidence in sepsis (20% vs. 26%), inhalation injury (46%
      vs. 27%), or mortality (8% vs. 7%) between those receiving rHGH or placebo. Serum
      IGF-I and IGFBP-3 increased with rHGH treatment, whereas serum IGFBP-1 decreased 
      compared with placebo (p < .05). Burned children treated with rHGH required
      significantly less albumin substitution to maintain normal levels compared with
      placebo (p < .05). Those receiving rHGH demonstrated a decrease in serum
      C-reactive protein and serum amyloid-A and an increase in serum retinol-binding
      protein compared with placebo (p < .05). rHGH decreased serum tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta, whereas no changes were found for serum 
      IL-1alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 compared with placebo (p < .05). Free fatty acids were
      elevated in burned children who received rHGH (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Data
      indicate that rHGH does not increase mortality. rHGH decreased acute phase
      proteins, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-1beta, which is associated with
      increases in constitutive hepatic proteins and IGF-I.

TI  - Physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors: effect of advice from an
      exercise specialist in Australian general practice.
PG  - 84-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether provision of individualised physical activity
      advice by an exercise specialist in general practice is effective in modifying
      physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors in older adults. DESIGN:
      Randomised controlled trial of individualised physical activity advice,
      reinforced at three and six months (intervention) versus no advice (control).
      SETTING: Two general practices in Adelaide, South Australia, 1996. PARTICIPANTS: 
      299 adults aged 60 years or more who were healthy, sedentary and living in the
      community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes to physical activity (frequency and
      duration of walking and vigorous exercise), selected cardiovascular risk factors 
      (blood pressure, body weight, serum lipid levels) and quality of life over 12
      months. RESULTS: Self-reported physical activity increased over the 12 months in 
      both groups (P < 0.001). The increase was greater for the intervention than the
      control group for all measures except time spent walking (P < 0.05). More
      intervention than control participants increased their intention to exercise (P <
      0.001). Serum levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
      triglycerides fell significantly over the 12 months to a similar extent in the
      two groups. No other significant changes in cardiovascular risk factors were
      seen. Quality-of-life scores decreased over the 12 months. The decrease was
      significantly greater among intervention than control women, but not men, for
      emotional well-being (P = 0.02), physical well-being (P = 0.04) and social
      functioning (P = 0.04). DISCUSSION: Provision of general practice-based physical 
      activity advice reinforced three-monthly produced a sustained increase in
      self-reported physical activity. However, there were no associated changes in
      clinical measures of cardiovascular risk factors and minimal changes in
      quality-of-life measures.

TI  - Prospective, randomized, controlled study of in vitro fertilization-embryo
      transfer with a single dose of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH)
      antagonist (cetrorelix) or a depot formula of an LH-RH agonist (triptorelin).
PG  - 314-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To confirm the value of a single dose of 3 mg of cetrorelix in
      preventing the occurrence of premature LH surges. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized,
      prospective study. SETTING: Reproductive medicine units. PATIENT(S): Infertile
      patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF-ET. INTERVENTION(S): A single
      dose of 3 mg of cetrorelix (Cetrotide; ASTA Medica, Frankfurt, Germany) (115
      patients) was administered in the late follicular phase. A depot preparation of
      triptorelin (Decapeptyl; Ipsen-Biotech, Paris, France) was chosen as a control
      agent (39 patients). Ovarian stimulation was conducted with hMG (Menogon;
      Ferring, Kiel, Germany). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Premature LH surges (LH level
      >10 IU/L), progesterone level greater than 1 ng/L, and IVF results. RESULT(S): No
      LH surge occurred after cetrorelix administration. The patients in the cetrorelix
      group had a lower number of oocytes and embryos. The percentage of mature oocytes
      and fertilization rates were similar in both groups, and the pregnancy rates were
      not statistically different. The length of stimulation, number of hMG ampules
      administered, and occurrence of the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were lower 
      in the cetrorelix group. Tolerance of cetrorelix was excellent. CONCLUSION(S): A

      compares favorably to the "long protocol" and could be a protocol of choice in
      IVF-ET.

AB  - This study assessed the safety and efficacy of filgrastim (r-metHuG-CSF
      [recombinant human methionine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]), when
      combined with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, in the treatment of hospitalized
      adult patients with multilobar community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Four hundred
      eighty patients were randomized to receive placebo (n=243) or filgrastim 300
      microg/day (n=237), in addition to standard therapy. Treatment with study drug
      was continued for 10 days, until the peak white blood cell (WBC) count reached
      75x109/L, until discharge from the hospital, until death, or until IV antibiotics
      were discontinued. Study-related observations continued through day 29.
      Filgrastim increased WBC counts (baseline median, 13.3x109/L; median peak, 43.
      8x109/L). The 2 treatment groups were not statistically different with respect to
      the study end points; however, there was a trend toward reduction of mortality in
      patients with pneumococcal bacteremia. Although further studies will be required 
      to validate this observation, filgrastim was safe and well tolerated when
      administered to patients with multilobar CAP.

TI  - Targeting aerosol deposition in patients with cystic fibrosis: effects of
      alterations in particle size and inspiratory flow rate.
PG  - 1069-76
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if aerosolized medications can be targeted to
      deposit in the smaller, peripheral airways or the larger, central airways of
      adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by varying particle size and inspiratory flow
      rate. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient research laboratory.
      PATIENTS: Nine adult patients with CF. INTERVENTIONS: Patients inhaled an aerosol
      comprised of 3.68+/-0.04 microm saline solution droplets (two visits) or 1.01+/- 
      0.2 microm saline solution droplets (two visits) for 30 s, starting from
      functional residual capacity and breathing at a slow or faster inspiratory flow
      rate. On all visits, the saline solution was admixed with the radioisotope
      (99m)Tc. Immediately after inhalation, a gamma camera recorded the deposition
      pattern of the radioaerosol in the lungs. Deposition images were analyzed in
      terms of the inner:outer zone (I:O) ratio, a measure of deposition in an inner
      zone (large, central airways) vs. an outer zone (small airways and alveoli).
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: For the 3.68-microm aerosol, I:O ratios averaged
      2.29+/-1.45 and 2.54+/-1.48 (p>0.05), indicating that aerosol distribution within
      the lungs was unchanged while breathing at 12+/-2 L/min vs. 31+/-5 L/min,
      respectively. For the 1.01-microm aerosol, I:O ratios averaged 2.09+/-0.96 and
      3.19+/-1.95 (p<0.05), indicating that deposition was predominantly in the smaller
      airways while breathing at 18+/-5 L/min and in the larger airways while breathing
      at 38+/-8 L/min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the
      targeted delivery of an aerosol to the smaller, peripheral airways or the larger,
      central airways of adult CF patients may be achieved by generating an aerosol
      comprised of approximately 1.0-microm particles and inspiring from functional
      residual capacity at approximately 18 L/min and approximately 38 L/min,
      respectively.

TI  - Effectiveness and safety of a nonremovable fiberglass off-bearing cast versus a
      therapeutic shoe in the treatment of neuropathic foot ulcers: a randomized study.
PG  - 1746-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the rate of reduction of the surface area of
      neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetic patients treated with nonremovable
      rigidity-differentiated fiberglass off-bearing casts or a cloth shoe with a rigid
      sole with unloading alkaform insoles. The secondary aim was to evaluate the side 
      effects and degree of patient acceptance of treatment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
      METHODS: Fifty diabetic patients with neuropathic plantar ulcers were
      consecutively enrolled and randomized to one of two treatment groups. Of the 50
      patients, 24 were treated with a specialized cloth shoe with a rigid sole and an 
      unloading alkaform insole (shoe group), and 26 patients were treated with a
      nonremovable off-bearing fiberglass cast (cast group). All patients in both study
      groups returned to the clinic for weekly control visits. Their ulcers were
      treated with a standard dressing. Tracings of the ulcer area using a transparent 
      dressing were performed on the day of entry to the study and after 30 days of
      treatment. The presence of new ulcerations caused by the use of the
      pressure-relief apparatus was recorded. Patient acceptance of the treatment was
      measured using a visual analog scale. RESULTS: At the end of the treatment
      period, an 8.3% increase of the ulcer area was observed in two patients in the
      shoe group, whereas in the cast group, no patient presented an increase. The
      reduction of the ulcer area was statistically more rapid in the cast group
      (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.0004). Furthermore, the number of ulcers completely
      healed at the 30-day time point was 13 (50%) in the cast group and 5 (20.8%) in
      the shoe group (P = 0.03). In both groups, no side effects were recorded. The
      average score +/- SD of patient acceptance was 91.15 +/- 9.9 in the shoe group
      and 88.33 +/- 17.3 (NS) in the cast group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown a
      significant difference in the speed of the reduction of neuropathic plantar
      ulcers treated with a fiberglass cast compared with a specialized cloth shoe. The
      use of fiberglass material with variable rigidity has also shown two important
      results: the elimination of side effects including ulcers caused by the cast, and
      high patient acceptance. These data show that the use of off-bearing casts made
      with fiberglass bandages of variable rigidity is the elective treatment of
      neuropathic plantar ulcers.

TI  - Effect of dofetilide in patients with recent myocardial infarction and
      left-ventricular dysfunction: a randomised trial.
PG  - 2052-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arrhythmias cause much morbidity and mortality after myocardial
      infarction, but in previous trials, antiarrhythmic drug therapy has not been
      convincingly effective. Dofetilide, a new class III agent, was investigated for
      effects on all-cause mortality and morbidity in patients with left-ventricular
      dysfunction after myocardial infarction. METHODS: In 37 Danish coronary-care
      units, 1510 patients with severe left-ventricular dysfunction (wall motion index 
      < or = 1.2, corresponding to ejection fraction < or = 0.35) were enrolled in a
      randomised, double-blind study comparing dofetilide (n=749) with placebo (n=761).
      The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included
      cardiac and arrhythmic mortality and total arrhythmic deaths. Analyses were by
      intention to treat. FINDINGS: No significant differences were found between the
      dofetilide and placebo groups in all-cause mortality (230 [31%] vs 243 [32%]),
      cardiac mortality (191 [26%] vs 212 [28%]), or total arrhythmic deaths (129 [17%]
      vs 140 [18%]). Atrial fibrillation or flutter was present in 8% of the patients
      at study entry. In these patients, dofetilide was significantly better than
      placebo at restoring sinus rhythm (25 of 59 vs seven of 56; p=0.002). There were 
      seven cases of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia, all in the dofetilide 
      group. INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe left-ventricular dysfunction and
      recent myocardial infarction, treatment with dofetilide did not affect all-cause 
      mortality, cardiac mortality, or total arrhythmic deaths. Dofetilide was
      effective in treating atrial fibrillation or flutter in this population.

TI  - Effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B6 on
      progression of subclinical atherosclerosis: a randomised, placebo-controlled
      trial.
PG  - 517-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high plasma homocysteine concentration is associated with increased
      risk of atherothrombotic disease. We investigated the effects of
      homocysteine-lowering treatment (folic acid plus vitamin B6) on markers of
      subclinical atherosclerosis among healthy siblings of patients with premature
      atherothrombotic disease. METHODS: We did a randomised, placebo-controlled trial 
      among 158 healthy siblings of 167 patients with premature atherothrombotic
      disease. 80 were assigned placebo and 78 were assigned 5 mg folic acid and 250 mg
      vitamin B6 daily for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the development or
      progression of subclinical atherosclerosis as estimated from exercise
      electrocardiography, the ankle-brachial pressure index, and carotid and femoral
      ultrasonography. FINDINGS: Ten participants in the treatment group, and 14 in the
      placebo group dropped out. Vitamin treatment, compared with placebo, was
      associated with a decrease in fasting homocysteine concentration (from 14.7 to
      7.4 micromol/L vs from 14.7 to 12.0 micromol/L), and in postmethionine
      homocysteine concentration (from 64.9 to 34.9 micromol/L vs from 64.8 to 50.3
      micromol/L). It was also associated with a decreased rate of abnormal exercise
      electrocardiography tests (odds ratio 0.40 [0.17-0.93]; p=0.035). There was no
      apparent effect of vitamin treatment on ankle-brachial pressure indices (0.87
      [0.56-1.33]), or on carotid and peripheral-arterial outcome variables (1.02
      [0.26-4.05] and 0.86 [0.47-1.59], respectively). INTERPRETATION:
      Homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B6 in healthy
      siblings of patients with premature atherothrombotic disease is associated with a
      decreased occurrence of abnormal exercise electrocardiography tests, which is
      consistent with a decreased risk of atherosclerotic coronary events.

      sleeping. SETTING: A smoking cessation research clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred
      and forty-four smokers who suffered morning cravings. INTERVENTION: Two patch
      formulations approved and marketed for over-the-counter use in the US--NicoDerm
      CQ (labeled as 21 mg over 24 hours) and Nicotrol (labeled as 15 mg over 16
      hours)--were each used according to its instructions. Smokers also received
      behavioral counseling. MEASUREMENTS: For a week of baseline and 2 weeks after
      quitting, smokers used palm-top computers to assess craving and withdrawal
      symptoms several times each day. FINDINGS: The 21 mg/24-hour patch yielded
      consistently better control of craving, not only during the morning hours, but
      throughout the day, and over the 2-week period of abstinence. Additionally, the
      21 mg/24-hour patch yielded greater reductions in anxiety, irritability and
      restlessness. Smokers using the 21 mg/24-hour dosing regimen also experienced
      longer abstinence than those using the 15 mg/16-hour patch. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings demonstrate that 24-hour dosing with a 21 mg patch affords superior
      relief of craving and withdrawal during the first 2 weeks of abstinence, when
      symptoms are at their peak, and when relapse is most likely. They confirm the
      importance of dosing parameters in nicotine replacement products.

TI  - Differential effects of dopamine, dopexamine, and dobutamine on jejunal mucosal
      perfusion early after cardiac surgery.
PG  - 2338-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential differential effects of dopamine,
      dopexamine, and dobutamine on jejunal mucosal perfusion, assessed by endoluminal 
      laser Doppler flowmetry in uncomplicated postcardiac surgical patients. DESIGN: A
      prospective, blinded, randomized, crossover study. SETTING: A cardiothoracic
      intensive care unit in a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: A total of ten
      postoperative cardiac surgical patients were studied. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient
      received sequentially, randomly, and in a blinded fashion 2.7+/-0.2 microg x
      kg(-1) x min(-1) dopamine, 0.7+/-0.1 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dopexamine, and
      2.7+/-0.1 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) dobutamine. Each inotropic agent was titrated
      to increase cardiac output by 25% from baseline. Data on jejunal mucosal
      perfusion, splanchnic lactate, and oxygen extraction were obtained during a 5-min
      control period and a 5-min drug infusion period after the target cardiac output
      was reached. The procedure was sequentially repeated for each agent, and there
      was a 20- to 30-min washout period between each agent. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN
      RESULTS: Dopamine, dopexamine, and dobutamine increased jejunal mucosal perfusion
      by 27% (p < .01), 20% (p < .001), and 7% (p < .001), respectively. The increase
      in jejunal mucosal perfusion by dopamine and dopexamine were significantly more
      pronounced compared with dobutamine (p < .05 and p < .01, respectively), whereas 
      there was no difference between dopamine and dopexamine. Splanchnic oxygen
      extraction decreased to the same extent with all three drugs. Splanchnic lactate 
      extraction did not change for any of the drugs. The effects on central
      hemodynamics were similar for the three inotropic agents. CONCLUSIONS:
      Endoluminal laser Doppler flowmetry is a new tool for the detection of perfusion 
      changes at the local intestinal mucosal level. Dopamine, dopexamine, and
      dobutamine have differential effects on jejunal mucosal perfusion probably
      because of their different receptor stimulating properties. These findings may be
      of clinical importance when the therapeutic goal is to improve gut mucosal
      perfusion.

TI  - Preemptive bupivacaine offers no advantages to postoperative wound infiltration
      in analgesia for outpatient breast biopsy.
PG  - 29-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate analgesia is important after surgery and in particular after
      ambulatory surgery. Preemptive administration of analgesics, ie, prior to
      commencing surgery, has many theoretical advantages. METHODS: In this prospective
      randomized study, the use of preincisional bupivacaine was compared with a
      postincision dose for the relief of postoperative pain, in 74 patients undergoing
      day-case breast biopsy. RESULTS: Demographic criteria were similar in both
      groups. There were no differences in pain scores postoperatively on the visual
      analog scale (VAS): VAS at 30 minutes 4.5 ([SD] 2.4) versus 4.7 (1.9); P = not
      significant (NS); VAS at 60 minutes 3.3 (2. 3) versus 3.6 (2.2); P = NS; VAS at
      120 minutes 1.9 (1.7) versus 2.5 (2.0); P = NS; VAS at 240 minutes 0.9 (1.0)
      versus 1.3 (1.4); P = NS. There was no difference in the number of patients
      requiring additional analgesia: 13 (36%) versus 18 (47%); P = NS. Nor was there a
      difference in the time to additional analgesia: 55.0 (37.8) versus 55.3 (39.2)
      minutes; P = NS. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of local anaesthesia prior to
      starting surgery does not appear to have any advantage over its postoperative
      administration in patients undergoing ambulatory breast biopsy.

TI  - Effect of a community intervention on patient delay and emergency medical service
      use in acute coronary heart disease: The Rapid Early Action for Coronary
      Treatment (REACT) Trial.
PG  - 60-7
AB  - CONTEXT: Delayed access to medical care in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI) is common and increases myocardial damage and mortality.
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a community intervention to reduce patient delay from
      symptom onset to hospital presentation and increase emergency medical service
      (EMS) use. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment
      Trial, a randomized trial conducted from 1995 to 1997 in 20 US cities (10 matched
      pairs; population range, 55,777-238,912) in 10 states. PARTICIPANTS: A total of
      59,944 adults aged 30 years or older presenting to hospital emergency departments
      (EDs) with chest pain, of whom 20,364 met the primary population criteria of
      suspected acute coronary heart disease on admission and were discharged with a
      coronary heart disease-related diagnosis. INTERVENTION: One city in each pair was
      randomly assigned to an 18-month intervention that targeted mass media, community
      organizations, and professional, public, and patient education to increase
      appropriate patient actions for AMI symptoms (primary population, n=10,563). The 
      other city in each pair was randomly assigned to reference status (primary
      population, n=9801). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time from symptom onset to ED arrival
      and EMS use, compared between intervention and reference city pairs. RESULTS:
      General population surveys provided evidence of increased public awareness and
      knowledge of program messages. Patient delay from symptom onset to hospital
      arrival at baseline (median, 140 minutes) was identical in the intervention and
      reference communities. Delay time decreased in intervention communities by -4.7% 
      per year (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.6% to -0.6%), but the change did not
      differ significantly from that observed in reference communities (-6. 8% per
      year; 95% CI, -14.5% to 1.6%; P=.54). EMS use by the primary study population
      increased significantly in intervention communities compared with reference
      communities, with a net effect of 20% (95% CI, 7%-34%; P<.005). Total numbers of 
      ED presentations for chest pain and patients with chest pain discharged from the 
      ED, as well as EMS use among patients with chest pain released from the ED, did
      not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, despite an 18-month
      intervention, time from symptom onset to hospital arrival for patients with chest
      pain did not change differentially between groups, although increased appropriate
      EMS use occurred in intervention communities. New strategies are needed if delay 
      time from symptom onset to hospital presentation is to be decreased further in
      patients with suspected AMI. JAMA. 2000;284:60-67

TI  - Azithromycin vs cefuroxime plus erythromycin for empirical treatment of
      community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients: a prospective, randomized,
      multicenter trial.
PG  - 1294-300
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of azithromycin dihydrate
      monotherapy with those of a combination of cefuroxime axetil plus erythromycin as
      empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
      METHODS: Patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, multicenter study. 
      The standard therapy of cefuroxime plus erythromycin was consistent with the
      American Thoracic Society, Canadian Community-Acquired Pneumonia Consensus Group,
      and Infectious Disease Society of America consensus guidelines. The doses were
      intravenous azithromycin (500 mg once daily) followed by oral azithromycin (500
      mg once daily), intravenous cefuroxime (750 mg every 8 hours), followed by oral
      cefuroxime axetil (500 mg twice daily), and erythromycin (500-1000 mg)
      intravenously or orally every 6 hours. Randomization was stratified by severity
      of illness and age. Patients who were immunosuppressed or residing in nursing
      homes were excluded. RESULTS: Data from 145 patients (67 received azithromycin
      and 78 received cefuroxime plus erythromycin) were evaluable. Streptococcus
      pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were isolated in 19% (28/145) and 13%
      (19/145), respectively. The atypical pathogens accounted for 33% (48/145) of the 
      etiologic diagnoses; Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma
      pneumoniae were identified in 14% (20/ 145), 10% (15/145), and 9% (13/145),
      respectively. Clinical cure was achieved in 91% (61/67) of the patients in the
      azithromycin group and 91% (71/78) in the cefuroxime plus erythromycin group.
      Adverse events (intravenous catheter site reactions, gastrointestinal tract
      disturbances) were significantly more common in patients who received cefuroxime 
      plus erythromycin (49% [30/78]) than in patients who received azithromycin (12%
      [8/67]) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with azithromycin was as effective as
      cefuroxime plus erythromycin in the empirical management of community-acquired
      pneumonia in immunocompetent patients who were hospitalized. Azithromycin was
      well tolerated.

TI  - Mother-infant interaction: effects of a home intervention and ongoing maternal
      drug use.
PG  - 424-31
AB  - Examined the effects of a home-based intervention on mother-infant interaction
      among drug-using women and their infants. At 2 weeks postpartum, mothers and
      infants were randomly assigned to either an intervention (n = 84) or a control (n
      = 87) group. Control families received brief monthly tracking visits, and
      intervention families received weekly visits by trained lay visitors.
      Mother-infant interaction was evaluated at 6 months through observation of
      feeding. Although there were no direct effects of the intervention, in the
      control group, mothers who continued to use drugs were less responsive to their
      babies than mothers who were drug free. In the intervention group, drug use was
      not associated with maternal responsiveness. Weekly home-based intervention may
      be a protective strategy for children of drug-using women because it disrupts the
      relation between ongoing maternal drug use and low maternal responsiveness.

      placebo during three months. The diagnosis was made by serology (specific IgA and
      IgG antibodies to yersinia outer membrane proteins (yops)), positive culture,
      and/or demonstration of Yersinia enterocolitica antigen in colon biopsy
      specimens. Patients were evaluated monthly during and after treatment up to 12
      months. Of 18 patients enrolled, all could be evaluated for safety, 16 for
      efficacy. There was a tendency towards faster remission and relief of pain in
      those receiving ciprofloxacin. Y enterocolitica was eliminated from the gut
      associated lymphoid tissue in six of seven patients receiving ciprofloxacin
      compared with none of nine patients receiving placebo. Patients receiving placebo
      had more and prolonged circulating IgA antibodies against yops than patients
      treated with ciprofloxacin.

TI  - Empowering diabetes out-patients with structured education: short-term and
      long-term effects of functional insulin treatment on perceived control over
      diabetes.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate short-term and long-term effects of structured
      outpatient education for Functional Insulin Treatment (FIT: selective insulin
      dosages for eating, fasting or correcting hyperglycaemia) on perceived control
      over diabetes and related health beliefs. FIT was thought to influence the
      perception of self-efficacy in diabetes, in contrast to conventional treatment,
      based on scheduled, rigid food intake and insulin delivery--it allows flexible
      eating, provided independent control of glycemia. METHODS: Structured,
      comprehensive, outpatient group training in FIT for selective use of insulin
      either for eating, fasting or correction included practical "insulin games." The 
      FIT program focused on everyday criteria for choices of insulin dosages and thus 
      on the patient's ability to execute his/her newly gained flexible treatment to
      his/her everyday life while preventing acute and late complications. To evaluate 
      effects of FIT on "Perceived Control over Diabetes" and related "Health Beliefs
      Concerning Diabetes" (Bradley's questionnaires, 1984), a fully randomized
      short-term controlled Study 1 (four weeks, 32 patients), and long-term
      uncontrolled pilot Study 2 (three years, 68 patients) were performed. RESULTS:
      The short-term study revealed that FIT induced the feeling of independence from
      situational control while self-managing diabetes. In the long-term study, the
      patients were increasingly freed from the feeling of being under the control of
      physician and treatment-related restrictions, which--together with higher
      perceived self-efficacy--contributed to the feeling of "empowerment." This was
      associated with high treatment satisfaction and significant improvement of
      glycemic control. CONCLUSION: Structured out-patient group training for FIT
      results in measurable improvement of patients' perceived control over diabetes
      and self-efficacy.

TI  - Exemestane is superior to megestrol acetate after tamoxifen failure in
      postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer: results of a phase III
      randomized double-blind trial. The Exemestane Study Group.
PG  - 1399-411
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase III, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study evaluated
      the efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and safety of the oral aromatase inactivator
      exemestane (EXE) versus megestrol acetate (MA) in postmenopausal women with
      progressive advanced breast cancer who experienced failure of tamoxifen. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: A total of 769 patients were randomized to EXE 25 mg/d (n = 366) or 
      MA (n = 403) 40 mg four times daily. Tumor response, duration of tumor control,
      tumor-related signs and symptoms (TRSS), quality of life (QOL), survival, and
      tolerability were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall objective response (OR) rates were 
      higher in patients treated with EXE than in those treated with MA (15.0% v
      12.4%); a similar trend was noted in patients with visceral metastases (13.5% v
      10.5%). Median survival time was significantly longer with EXE (median not
      reached) than with MA (123.4 weeks; P =.039), as were the median duration of
      overall success (OR or stable disease > or = 24 weeks; 60.1 v 49.1 weeks; P
      =.025), time to tumor progression (20.3 v 16.6 weeks; P =.037), and time to
      treatment failure (16.3 v 15.7 weeks; P =.042). Compared with MA, there were
      similar or greater improvements in pain, TRSS, and QOL with EXE. Both drugs were 
      well tolerated. Grade 3 or 4 weight changes were more common with MA (17.1% v
      7.6%; P =.001). CONCLUSION: EXE prolongs survival time, time to tumor
      progression, and time to treatment failure compared with MA and offers a
      well-tolerated treatment option for postmenopausal women with progressive
      advanced breast cancer who experienced failure of tamoxifen.

TI  - Feasibility and safety of AS-3 red blood cells for neonatal transfusions.
PG  - 215-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Most extremely low birth weight (<1 kg) infants receive red blood
      cell (RBC) transfusions. RBCs stored up to 42 days can be transfused safely in
      small volumes to preterm infants; however, because the formulation of RBC
      anticoagulant/preservative solutions differs, clinical studies are required to
      document the safety of each solution before widespread use. Our goal was to study
      the feasibility and safety of AS-3 anticoagulant/preservative solution to preterm
      infants. STUDY DESIGN: Two clinical studies were conducted in sequence: (1) a
      randomized trial to compare RBC transfusions given as stored (< or =42 days) AS-3
      RBCs (11 infants) versus fresh (< or = 7 days) citrate, phosphate, dextrose, and 
      adenine RBCs (10 infants) and (2) a subsequent evaluation of the safety of stored
      AS-3 RBCs in 33 additional preterm infants given 120 AS-3 RBC transfusions.
      RESULTS: Results of both the randomized study and the subsequent evaluation
      documented that AS-3 RBCs stored < or =42 days and transfused in small volumes
      (15 mL/kg) were safe for RBC transfusions of preterm infants. Donor exposure was 
      significantly reduced, clinical transfusion reactions were rare, and
      post-transfusion blood hematocrit, pH, and plasma Na, K, Ca, lactate, and glucose
      measurements were similar when AS-3 and citrate, phosphate, dextrose, and adenine
      RBC transfusions were compared. CONCLUSIONS: AS-3 RBCs can be used safely for
      small-volume RBC transfusions for preterm infants.

TI  - Meclizine for prevention of nausea associated with use of emergency contraceptive
      pills: a randomized trial.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether pretreatment with
      meclizine reduces the incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with the Yuzpe 
      regimen of emergency contraception. METHODS: We randomly assigned 343 women aged 
      18-45 years who were not at risk for pregnancy to pretreatment with 50 mg of
      meclizine, placebo, or no drug 1 hour before the first of two doses of emergency 
      contraceptive pills. We asked participants to complete three questionnaires over 
      the following 48 hours. RESULTS: The incidence of nausea was 47% in the group
      pretreated with meclizine and 64% in the other two groups (relative risk adjusted
      for center 0.7, 95% confidence intervals 0.6, 0.9 for comparisons of meclizine
      with both placebo and no drug). The severity of nausea and the incidence of
      vomiting were also significantly lower in the meclizine pretreatment group than
      in the other two groups. Drowsiness was reported by about twice as many women in 
      the meclizine pretreatment group (31%) than in the other two groups (13% in the
      placebo group, 16% in the no-pretreatment group; P < .01 for both comparisons).
      CONCLUSION: Meclizine is effective for preventing nausea and vomiting associated 
      with the Yuzpe regimen of emergency contraceptive pills. Women using this drug
      should be cautioned to anticipate drowsiness.

      patients in the intensive care unit: interim analysis of a prospective,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind study.
PG  - 3620-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      filgrastim in the prevention of nosocomial infections in intubated patients in
      the intensive care unit (ICU), with special emphasis on the possible deleterious 
      effect on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the development of
      multiple organ dysfunction (MOD). DESIGN: Predetermined, interim analysis of a
      prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. SETTING:
      University hospital medical-surgical ICU. PATIENTS: A total of 59 consecutive ICU
      patients, aged >18 yrs, admitted to the ICU no more than 12 hrs before the study,
      intubated because of ventilatory insufficiency no more than 48 hrs before the
      study, expected to stay in the ICU for >48 hrs, and had informed consent from the
      next relative. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive either placebo 
      or 300 microg of filgrastim subcutaneously once daily for 7 days. MEASUREMENTS
      AND MAIN RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the number of patients
      developing ARDS (2 of 20 in the placebo group vs. 0 of 22 in the filgrastim
      group), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3 of 27 vs. 3 of 29), acute renal
      failure (1 of 27 vs. 1 of 23), or change in MOD. Data analysis showed nosocomial 
      infections in 11 of 29 patients in the placebo group and in 7 of 30 patients in
      the filgrastim group (p = .266). The median (range) length of ICU stay was 8
      (1-34) days in the placebo group and 6 days (1-28) in the filgrastim group. The
      day 28 mortality rate was 17% (5 of 29) in the placebo group and 13% (4 of 30) in
      the filgrastim group. No drug-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION:

TI  - Budesonide or prednisone in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in primary
      sclerosing cholangitis: a randomized double-blind pilot study. Belgian-Dutch PSC 
      Study Group.
PG  - 2015-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: PSC has characteristics of an (auto)immune-mediated disease: however, 
      few studies have evaluated corticosteroid therapy for this disorder. METHODS: We 
      performed an 8-wk double-blind randomized pilot study to assess the effects of
      additional treatment with 9 mg budesonide (n = 6) versus 3 mg budesonide (n = 6) 
      versus 10 mg prednisone (n = 6) in patients who had been treated with UDCA (mean 
      dose, 12 mg/kg/day) for at least 5 months without achieving biochemical
      remission. Pruritus and fatigue were evaluated using visual analog scales. Serum 
      liver biochemistry was measured every 4 wk. At entry and at the end of the trial,
      adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were
      measured to assess effects on the pituitary-adrenal axis. Duodenal bile was
      collected for assessment of biliary corticosteroid activity. RESULTS: Pruritus
      decreased significantly more in the prednisone group compared to both the 3-mg
      and the 9-mg budesonide groups (p < 0.05). Alkaline phosphatase (mean: -23.4%; p 
      = 0.03) and IgG (mean: -16.2%; p = 0.04) decreased in the prednisone group,
      whereas bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and
      alanine aminotransferase did not change significantly. No significant clinical or
      liver biochemical changes were observed in the 3-mg and 9-mg budesonide groups.
      Significantly larger drops in serum ACTH were found in the 10-mg prednisone group
      (-40.7%; p = 0.04) and 9-mg budesonide group (-36.6%; p = 0.02) compared to the
      3-mg budesonide group (+ 19.0%). No significant differences in percentage change 
      in baseline values for DHEA between the three treatment arms were found.
      Mononuclear cell proliferation assays did not demonstrate corticosteroid activity
      in bile. Autoimmune hepatitis was observed in one case (9 mg budesonide) when
      corticosteroids were tapered off. CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot study
      suggest only minor beneficial short-term effects of prednisone but not budesonide
      on symptoms and serum liver tests in UDCA-treated PSC patients.

TI  - Systemic cytokine response after laparoscopic-assisted resection of rectosigmoid 
      carcinoma: A prospective randomized trial.
PG  - 506-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the systemic cytokine response in patients after
      laparoscopic-assisted resection with those after open resection of rectosigmoid
      carcinoma. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Laparoscopic resection of colorectal
      carcinoma is technically feasible, but objective evidence of its benefit is
      scarce. Systemic cytokines are accepted as markers of postoperative tissue trauma
      and mediators of the host immune response. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with
      rectosigmoid carcinoma, without evidence of metastatic disease and suitable for
      laparoscopic resection, were randomized to undergo either laparoscopic (n = 17)
      or conventional open (n = 17) resection of the tumor. Clinical parameters were
      recorded. Sera were collected before surgery and at appropriate time points
      afterward and assayed for interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
      interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein. The primary end points were the cytokine
      and C-reactive protein levels. Data were analyzed by intention to treat. RESULTS:
      The demographic data of the two groups were comparable. The clinical outcome of
      both groups was satisfactory, with no surgical deaths and a reasonable
      complication rate. Both interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 levels peaked 2 hours
      after surgery, with the responses in the laparoscopic group significantly less
      than those in the open group. C-reactive protein levels peaked at 48 hours, and
      the difference was also statistically significant. Levels of tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha were not elevated after surgery, and there was no difference between
      the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue trauma, as reflected by systemic cytokine
      response, was less after laparoscopic resection than after open resection of
      rectosigmoid carcinoma. The difference in the systemic cytokine response may have
      implications on the long-term survival.

TI  - Cognitive and family therapies for adolescent depression: treatment specificity, 
      mediation, and moderation.
PG  - 603-14
AB  - The specificity of cognitive and family therapies, and potential treatment
      mediators and moderators, was examined in a randomized clinical trial for
      adolescent depression. After acute treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      exerted specific effects on cognitive distortions relative to either
      systemic-behavioral family therapy (SBFT) or nondirective supportive therapy
      (NST). At 2-year follow-up, SBFT was found to impact family conflict and
      parent-child relationship problems more than CBT; NST and CBT tended to show a
      greater reduction in anxiety symptoms than SBFT. Nonspecific therapist variables 
      qualified few outcome analyses. No measures of cognitive distortion or family
      dysfunction mediated or moderated treatment outcome. As in adult studies,
      relatively few areas of treatment specificity or mediation were identified. The
      implications of these findings for clinical treatment and research in adolescent 
      depression are discussed.

TI  - Phase III multicenter randomized trial of oxaliplatin added to chronomodulated
      fluorouracil-leucovorin as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
PG  - 136-47
AB  - PURPOSE: To study how adding oxaliplatin (l-OHP) to chronomodulated fluorouracil 
      (5-FU)-leucovorin (LV) affected the objective response rate, as first-line
      treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred
      patients from 15 institutions in four countries were randomly assigned to receive
      a 5-day course of chronomodulated 5-FU and LV (700 and 300 mg/m(2)/d,
      respectively; peak delivery rate at 0400 hours) with or without l-OHP on the
      first day of each course (125 mg/m(2), as a 6-hour infusion). Each course was
      repeated every 21 days. Response was assessed by extramural review of computed
      tomography scans. RESULTS: Grade 3 to 4 toxicity from 5-FU-LV occurred in </= 5% 
      of the patients (</= 1% of the courses). Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea occurred in 43% of
      the patients given l-OHP (10% of the courses), and less than 2% of the patients
      had severe hematotoxicity. Thirteen percent of the patients had moderate
      functional impairment from peripheral sensory neuropathy. Sixteen percent of the 
      patients receiving 5-FU-LV had an objective response (95% confidence interval
      [CI], 9% to 24%), compared with 53% of those receiving additional l-OHP (95% CI, 
      42% to 63%) (P <. 001). The median progression-free survival time was 6.1 months 
      with 5-FU-LV (range, 4.1 to 7.4 months) and 8.7 months (7.4 to 9.2 months) with
      l-OHP and 5-FU-LV (P =.048). Median survival times were 19.9 and 19.4 months,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: By chronomodulating 5-FU-LV, we were able to add l-OHP 
      without compromising dose-intensities. l-OHP significantly improved the antitumor
      efficacy of this regimen.

TI  - Self-help weight loss versus a structured commercial program after 26 weeks: a
      randomized controlled study.
PG  - 282-7
AB  - PURPOSE: There have been few randomized controlled trials of commercial
      weight-loss programs. This ongoing study compares the effects of a self-help
      program and a commercial program on weight loss and other measures of obesity in 
      overweight and obese men and women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We report the results
      of the first 26 weeks of a multicenter, randomized, 2-year study of 423 subjects 
      who had a body mass index of 27 to 40 kg/m(2). Subjects were randomly assigned to
      either a self-help program, consisting of two 20-minute sessions with a
      nutritionist and provision of printed materials and other self-help resources, or
      to attendance at meetings of a commercial program (Weight Watchers). Outcome
      measures were changes in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and
      body fat. Changes in serum homocysteine levels were measured in a subsample of
      participants during the first 12 weeks. RESULTS: After 26 weeks, subjects in the 
      commercial program, as compared with those in the self-help program, had greater 
      decreases in body weight [mean (+/- SD) -4.8+/-5.6 vs -1.4+/-4.7 kg] and body
      mass index (-1.7+/-1.9 vs -0.5+/-1.6 kg/m(2), both P<0.001) in intention-to-treat
      analyses. Among subjects measured at week 26, mean waist circumference
      (-4.3+/-10.5 vs -0.7+/-12.7 cm) and fat mass (-3.8 +/-7.0 vs -1.5+/-7.6 kg, both 
      P<0.05) also decreased more among subjects in the commercial program. Mean serum 
      homocysteine levels improved in the commercial program compared with self-help
      (-0.5+/-1.3 vs 0.9+/-1.8 microM, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A structured commercial
      weight-loss program is more likely to be effective for managing moderately
      overweight patients than brief counseling and self-help.

TI  - Coronary stenting plus platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockade compared with
      tissue plasminogen activator in acute myocardial infarction. Stent versus
      Thrombolysis for Occluded Coronary Arteries in Patients with Acute Myocardial
      Infarction Study Investigators.
PG  - 385-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevention of myocardial damage is the main goal of all reperfusion
      therapies in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The relative efficacy of 
      various reperfusion strategies is under intensive investigation. We assessed
      whether coronary stenting combined with the blockade of platelet glycoprotein
      IIb/IIIa receptors produces a greater degree of myocardial salvage than
      fibrinolysis with an accelerated infusion of alteplase, a tissue plasminogen
      activator, in patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: A total of 140 
      patients were enrolled in the randomized trial; 71 were assigned to receive a
      stent plus abciximab, and 69 to receive intravenous alteplase. The primary end
      point was the degree of myocardial salvage, determined by means of serial
      scintigraphic studies with technetium Tc 99m sestamibi. The secondary end point
      was a composite of death, reinfarction, and stroke within six months after
      randomization. RESULTS: In the group that received a stent plus abciximab, the
      median size of the final infarct was 14.3 percent of the left ventricle (25th and
      75th percentiles, 6.8 and 24.5 percent), as compared with a median of 19.4
      percent (25th and 75th percentiles, 7.9 and 34.2 percent) in the alteplase group 
      (P=0.02). This difference was due to the larger salvage index (the percentage of 
      the left ventricle that was salvaged, divided by the percentage that was
      compromised by the initial perfusion defect) in the stent group: 0.57 (25th and
      75th percentiles, 0.35 and 0.69), as compared with 0.26 (25th and 75th
      percentiles, 0.09 and 0.61; P<0.001). The cumulative incidence of death,
      reinfarction, or stroke at six months was lower in the stent group than in the
      alteplase group (8.5 vs. 23.2 percent. P=0.02; relative risk, 0.34; 95 percent
      confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute
      myocardial infarction, coronary stenting plus abciximab leads to a greater degree
      of myocardial salvage and a better clinical outcome than does fibrinolysis with a
      tissue plasminogen activator.

TI  - Mature results of a phase III randomized trial comparing concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy with radiation therapy alone in patients with stage III and IV 
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
PG  - 876-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study presents mature results from a Phase III randomized
      trial comparing radiation therapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients
      with resectable American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage III and IV disease.
      METHODS: One hundred patients were randomized to receive either radiation therapy
      alone (Arm A) (at a dose of between 66-72 grays [Gy] at 1.8-2 Gy per day) and the
      identical radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (Arm B) (5-fluorouracil,
      1000 mg/m(2)/day, and cisplatin, 20 mg/m(2)/day, both given as continuous
      intravenous infusions over 4 days beginning on Days 1 and 22 of the radiation
      therapy). Primary site resection was planned for patients with residual or
      recurrent local disease. Cervical lymph node dissection was performed for
      regional persistent disease or recurrence, or if N2-3 disease was present at the 
      time of presentation. RESULTS: After completing all therapy including surgery,
      82% of the patients in Arm A and 98% of the patients in Arm B had been rendered
      disease free (P = 0.02). At a median follow-up of 5 years (range, 3-8 years), the
      5-year Kaplan-Meier projections for overall survival for Arm A versus Arm B were 
      48% versus 50% (P = 0.55). Kaplan-Meier projections for the recurrence free
      interval were 51% versus 62% (P = 0.04), projections for a distant metastasis
      free interval were 75% versus 84% (P = 0. 09), projections for overall survival
      with primary site preservation were 34% versus 42% (P = 0.004), and projections
      for local control without surgical resection were 45% versus 77% (P < 0.001).
      Salvage surgery proved to be successful in 63% and 73%, respectively, of the Arm 
      A and Arm B patients with primary site failure. Unrelated death while free of
      disease occurred in 22% and 32%, respectively, of Arm A and Arm B patients (P =
      0.26). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of concurrent chemotherapy to definitive
      radiation in patients with resectable Stage III and IV squamous cell carcinoma of
      the head and neck improves the likelihood of disease clearance, a recurrence free
      interval, and primary site preservation. However, overall survival does not
      appear to be improved, reflecting both effective surgical salvage after local
      recurrence and competing causes of death.

TI  - Azithromycin vs cefuroxime plus erythromycin for empirical treatment of
      community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients: a prospective, randomized,
      multicenter trial.
PG  - 1294-300
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of azithromycin dihydrate
      monotherapy with those of a combination of cefuroxime axetil plus erythromycin as
      empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
      METHODS: Patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, multicenter study. 
      The standard therapy of cefuroxime plus erythromycin was consistent with the
      American Thoracic Society, Canadian Community-Acquired Pneumonia Consensus Group,
      and Infectious Disease Society of America consensus guidelines. The doses were
      intravenous azithromycin (500 mg once daily) followed by oral azithromycin (500
      mg once daily), intravenous cefuroxime (750 mg every 8 hours), followed by oral
      cefuroxime axetil (500 mg twice daily), and erythromycin (500-1000 mg)
      intravenously or orally every 6 hours. Randomization was stratified by severity
      of illness and age. Patients who were immunosuppressed or residing in nursing
      homes were excluded. RESULTS: Data from 145 patients (67 received azithromycin
      and 78 received cefuroxime plus erythromycin) were evaluable. Streptococcus
      pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were isolated in 19% (28/145) and 13%
      (19/145), respectively. The atypical pathogens accounted for 33% (48/145) of the 
      etiologic diagnoses; Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma
      pneumoniae were identified in 14% (20/ 145), 10% (15/145), and 9% (13/145),
      respectively. Clinical cure was achieved in 91% (61/67) of the patients in the
      azithromycin group and 91% (71/78) in the cefuroxime plus erythromycin group.
      Adverse events (intravenous catheter site reactions, gastrointestinal tract
      disturbances) were significantly more common in patients who received cefuroxime 
      plus erythromycin (49% [30/78]) than in patients who received azithromycin (12%
      [8/67]) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with azithromycin was as effective as
      cefuroxime plus erythromycin in the empirical management of community-acquired
      pneumonia in immunocompetent patients who were hospitalized. Azithromycin was
      well tolerated.

TI  - Pool exercise combined with an education program for patients with fibromyalgia
      syndrome. A prospective, randomized study.
PG  - 2473-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of 6 months of pool exercise combined with a 6
      session education program for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM). METHODS: 
      The study population comprised 58 patients, randomized to a treatment or a
      control group. Patients were instructed to match the pool exercises to their
      threshold of pain and fatigue. The education focused on strategies for coping
      with symptoms and encouragement of physical activity. The primary outcome
      measurements were the total score of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) 
      and the 6 min walk test, recorded at study start and after 6 mo. Several other
      tests and instruments assessing functional limitations, severity of symptoms,
      disabilities, and quality of life were also applied. RESULTS: Significant
      differences between the treatment group and the control group were found for the 
      FIQ total score (p = 0.017) and the 6 min walk test (p < 0.0001). Significant
      differences were also found for physical function, grip strength, pain severity, 
      social functioning, psychological distress, and quality of life. CONCLUSION: The 
      results suggest that a 6 month program of exercises in a temperate pool combined 
      with education will improve the consequences of FM.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of ultrasonography in diagnosis of acute
      appendicitis, incorporating the Alvarado score.
PG  - 919-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether diagnosis by graded compression ultrasonography 
      improves clinical outcomes for patients with suspected appendicitis. DESIGN: A
      randomised controlled trial comparing clinical diagnosis (control) with a
      diagnostic protocol incorporating ultrasonography and the Alvarado score
      (intervention group). SETTING: Single tertiary referral centre. PARTICIPANTS: 302
      patients (age 5-82 years) referred to the surgical service with suspected
      appendicitis. 160 patients were randomised to the intervention group, of whom 129
      underwent ultrasonography. Ultrasonography was omitted for patients with extreme 
      Alvarado scores (1-3, 9, or 10) unless requested by the admitting surgical team. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to operation, duration of hospital stay, and adverse 
      outcomes, including non-therapeutic operations and delayed treatment in
      association with perforation. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of
      ultrasonography were measured at 94. 7% and 88.9%, respectively. Patients in the 
      intervention group who underwent therapeutic operation had a significantly
      shorter mean time to operation than patients in the control group (7.0 v 10.2
      hours, P=0.016). There were no differences between groups in mean duration of
      hospital stay (53.4 v 54.5 hours, P=0.84), proportion of patients undergoing a
      non-therapeutic operation (9% v 11%, P=0.59) or delayed treatment in association 
      with perforation (3% v 1%, P=0.45). CONCLUSION: Graded compression
      ultrasonography is an accurate procedure that leads to the prompt diagnosis and
      early treatment of many cases of appendicitis, although it does not prevent
      adverse outcomes or reduce length of hospital stay.

TI  - Reducing risk factors for eating disorders: comparison of an Internet- and a
      classroom-delivered psychoeducational program.
PG  - 650-7
AB  - This controlled trial compared Internet- (Student Bodies [SB]) and
      classroom-delivered (Body Traps [BT]) psychoeducational interventions for the
      reduction of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors/attitudes with 
      a control condition. Participants were 76 women at a private university who were 
      randomly assigned to SB, BT, or a wait-list control (WLC) condition. Measures of 
      body image and eating attitudes and behaviors were measured at baseline,
      posttreatment, and 4-month follow-up. At posttreatment, participants in SB had
      significant reductions in weight/shape concerns and disordered eating attitudes
      compared with those in the WLC condition. At follow-up, disordered behaviors were
      also reduced. No significant effects were found between the BT and WLC
      conditions. An Internet-delivered intervention had a significant impact on
      reducing risk factors for eating disorders.

TI  - Oral anticoagulation self-management and management by a specialist
      anticoagulation clinic: a randomised cross-over comparison.
PG  - 97-102
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonist treatment is effective for prevention and
      treatment of thromboembolic events but frequent laboratory control and
      dose-adjustment are essential. Small portable devices have enabled patient
      self-monitoring of anticoagulation and self-adjustment of the dose. We compared
      this self-management of oral anticoagulant therapy with conventional management
      by a specialist anticoagulation clinic in a randomised cross-over study. METHODS:
      50 patients on long-term oral anticoagulant treatment were included in a
      randomised controlled crossover study. Patients were self-managed or were managed
      by the anticoagulation clinic for a period of 3 months. After this period the
      alternative strategy was followed for each patient. Prothrombin time (expressed
      as international normalised ratio [INR]) were measured at intervals of 1-2 weeks 
      in both periods without knowledge of type of management. The primary endpoint was
      the number of measurements within the therapeutic range (therapeutic target value
      +/-50.5 INR units). FINDINGS: There was no significant difference in the overall 
      quality of control of anticoagulation between the two study periods. Patients
      were for 55% and for 49% of the treatment period within a range of +/-0.5 from
      the therapeutic target INR during self-management and anticoagulation clinic
      management, respectively (p=0.06). The proportion of patients who spent most time
      in the therapeutic target range was larger during self-management than during
      anticoagulation clinic-guided management. The odds ratio for a better control of 
      anticoagulation (defined as the period of time in the therapeutic target range)
      during self-management compared with anticoagulation clinic-guided management was
      4.6 (95% CI 2.1-10.2). A patient-satisfaction assessment showed superiority of
      self-management over conventional care. INTERPRETATION: Self-management of INR in
      the population in this study is feasible and appears to result in control of
      anticoagulation that is at least equivalent to management by a specialist
      anticoagulation clinic. It is also better appreciated by patients. Larger studies
      are required to assess the effect of this novel management strategy on the
      incidence of thromboembolic or bleeding complications.

TI  - Effects of specific immunotherapy in allergic rhinitic individuals with bronchial
      hyperresponsiveness.
PG  - 2048-52
AB  - Allergic rhinitis can be associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and
      carries an increased risk for the development of asthma. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the ability of specific immunotherapy (SIT) to reduce the
      progression of allergic rhinitis to asthma and prevent the associated increase in
      BHR. Forty-four subjects monosensitized to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, with
      perennial rhinitis and BHR to methacholine, were randomly assigned to receive SIT
      or placebo in a double-blind study conducted over a period of 2 yr. After 1 yr of
      treatment, a 2.88-fold increase in the provocative dose of methacholine producing
      a 20% decrease in FEV(1) (PD(20)FEV(1)) was recorded in the SIT-treated group
      (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.98- to 2.09-fold; p < 0.001), with a further
      increase to fourfold at the end of Year 2 (95% CI: 2.9- to 5.7-fold; p < 0.001). 
      At the end of the study, the methacholine PD(20)FEV(1) was within the normal
      range in 50% of treated subjects (p < 0.0001), and was significantly higher in
      this group than in the group receiving placebo (p < 0.0001). In contrast, no
      changes in methacholine PD(20)FEV(1) were found in the placebo group throughout
      the study. Although 9% of subjects given placebo developed asthma, none of those 
      treated with SIT did. This study suggests that SIT, when administered to
      carefully selected, monosensitized patients with perennial allergic rhinitis,
      reduces airway responsiveness in subjects with rhinitis, and may be an
      appropriate prophylactic treatment for rhinitic patients with hyperreactive
      airways.

TI  - Relationship between dopamine D(2) occupancy, clinical response, and side
      effects: a double-blind PET study of first-episode schizophrenia.
PG  - 514-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since all antipsychotics block dopamine D(2) receptors, the authors
      investigated how well D(2) receptor occupancy in vivo predicts clinical response,
      extrapyramidal side effects, and hyperprolactinemia. METHOD: In a double-blind
      study, 22 patients with first-episode schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 1.0
      or 2. 5 mg/day of haloperidol. After 2 weeks of treatment, D(2) receptor
      occupancy was determined with [(11)C]raclopride and positron emission tomography,
      and clinical response, extrapyramidal side effects, and prolactin levels were
      measured. Patients who showed adequate responses continued taking their initial
      doses, those who did not respond had their doses increased to 5.0 mg/day, and
      evaluations were repeated at 4 weeks for all patients. RESULTS: The patients
      showed a wide range of D(2) occupancy (38%-87%). The degree of receptor occupancy
      predicted clinical improvement, hyperprolactinemia, and extrapyramidal side
      effects. The likelihood of clinical response, hyperprolactinemia, and
      extrapyramidal side effects increased significantly as D(2) occupancy exceeded
      65%, 72%, and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that D(2)
      occupancy is an important mediator of response and side effects in antipsychotic 
      treatment. The data are consistent with a "target and trigger" hypothesis of
      antipsychotic action, i.e., that the D(2) receptor specificity of antipsychotics 
      permits them to target discrete neurons and that their antagonist properties
      trigger within those neurons intracellular changes that ultimately beget
      antipsychotic response. While limited to haloperidol, the relationship between
      D(2) occupancy and side effects in this study helps explain many of the observed 
      clinical differences between typical and atypical antipsychotics.

TI  - Clips versus suture technique: is there a difference?
PG  - 1403-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is one of the most common
      procedures performed today, and wound complications are a major source of
      morbidity and cost. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is any difference in
      wound outcome (including cost in a Canadian context) between a subcuticular
      suture technique and skin stapling technique for closure of sternal and leg
      incisions in CABG patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two
      patients undergoing CABG were prospectively, randomly placed to have their
      sternal and leg incisions closed with either a subcuticular suture technique or
      with a skin clip. Data were obtained through chart review, in-hospital
      assessments and follow-up visits. Nonblinded assessments were made regarding
      wound leakage, inflammation, infection, necrosis, swelling, dehiscence and
      cosmesis. Each of the parameters was graded on a scale from 1 to 4. The cost was 
      evaluated in Canadian dollars. RESULTS: There were trends toward increased rates 
      of in-hospital sternal (P=0.09) and leg (P=0.17) incision inflammation when the
      wounds were closed with skin clips. There was a significantly greater (P=0.05)
      rate of sternal wound infection with clips, as well as a tendency (P=0.15) toward
      a greater rate of mediastinitis at follow-up assessment. Cosmetic outcome was
      similar for both groups. The cost incurred was significantly greater when skin
      clips were used for closure. There was a greater than threefold difference, which
      translates to a greater than $10,000 difference over one year. CONCLUSIONS:
      Closure with a subcuticular technique achieves better outcomes than the use of
      skin clips. When factoring in the increased cost incurred by using clips, as well
      as other intangible factors such as surgical skill acquisition, subcuticular
      suture closure appears to be a favourable method of wound closure in CABG
      patients compared with the use of skin stapling techniques.

TI  - Effect of preoperative oral dextromethorphan on immediate and late postoperative 
      pain and hyperalgesia after total abdominal hysterectomy.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - Dextromethorphan is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
      antagonist known to inhibit wind-up and NMDA-mediated nociceptive responses of
      dorsal horn neurons. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that
      NMDA-receptor antagonists may potentiate the effect of analgesics such as
      morphine, local anesthetics and NSAIDs. Results from previous clinical studies of
      dextromethorphan in postoperative pain are conflicting, possibly related to
      administration of insufficient doses of the drug. Fifty patients scheduled for
      non-malignant elective abdominal hysterectomy in general anesthesia were
      randomized to receive oral dextromethorphan 150 mg, or placebo 1 h before
      surgery. The patients received patient-controlled analgesia with morphine for 24 
      h postoperatively as the only analgesic. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)
      morphine consumption was reduced with 30% from 0-4 h after operation in patients 
      receiving dextromethorphan compared with placebo (P=0.02); no differences were
      observed from 5-24 h postoperatively. There were no significant differences
      between groups for visual analogue scale scores at rest, during cough, or during 
      mobilization, pressure pain detection thresholds, von Frey hair pain detection
      thresholds, or peak flow. At 24 h after operation, hyperalgesia to von Frey hair 
      stimulation proximal to the surgical wound was easily detected in 23 of 25
      patients receiving dextromethorphan, and in 22 of 25 patients receiving placebo, 
      with no significant difference between groups. Pooled data from both groups
      showed a weak but significant correlation between the extent of hyperalgesia at
      24 h after operation, and total 24 h postoperative PCA morphine consumption
      (Rs=0.28, P=0.05). Three months postoperatively, hyperalgesia was still
      detectable in 18 of 22 examined patients in the dextromethorphan group, and in 16
      of 23 patients in the placebo group, without statistical differences between
      groups. There were no significant differences in side-effects (nausea, vomiting, 
      sedation). In conclusion, oral dextromethorphan 150 mg reduced PCA morphine
      consumption immediately (0-4 h) after hysterectomy, without prolonged effects on 
      pain or wound hyperalgesia. A positive correlation between the magnitude of wound
      hyperalgesia at 24 h after operation, and total 24 h postoperative PCA morphine
      consumption was demonstrated.

TI  - Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of atosiban and ritodrine in the
      treatment of preterm labor: a multicenter effectiveness and safety study.
PG  - 1191-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of
      intravenous administration of atosiban versus ritodrine for the treatment of
      preterm labor. STUDY DESIGN: Women with preterm labor and intact membranes
      diagnosed at 23 to 33 gestational weeks (n = 247) were randomly assigned to
      treatment arms and received atosiban (6.75 mg intravenous bolus, 300 microg/min
      for 3 hours, then 100 microg/min intravenously) or ritodrine (0.10-0.35 mg/min
      intravenously) for as long as 18 hours. Tocolytic effectiveness was assessed in
      terms of the numbers of women who had not been delivered after 48 hours and after
      7 days. Safety was assessed in terms of maternal side effects and neonatal
      morbidity. Secondary outcomes included mean gestational age at delivery and mean 
      birth weight. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed with the
      Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. RESULTS: The proportion of women who had not been
      delivered at 48 hours was 84.9% (n = 107) in the atosiban group and 86.8% (n =
      105) in the ritodrine group. At 7 days 92 women had still not been delivered in
      both the atosiban (73.0%) and ritodrine (76.0%) groups. Neither of these
      differences was statistically significant. The incidence of maternal
      cardiovascular side effects was substantially lower in the atosiban group (4.0%
      vs 84.3%, P <.001). In addition, intravenous therapy was terminated more
      frequently as a result of maternal adverse events in the ritodrine group (29.8%) 
      than in the atosiban group (0.8%). The overall occurrences of fetal adverse
      events in the two treatment groups were comparable. Neonatal morbidity was
      similar between the treatment groups after adjustment for unbalanced enrollment
      of women with multiple pregnancies and for gestational ages within treatment
      groups. CONCLUSION: Atosiban was comparable in clinical effectiveness to
      conventional ritodrine therapy but was better tolerated than ritodrine, with no
      evidence of significant maternal or fetal adverse events. Neonatal morbidity,
      which was similar between the two treatment arms, was apparently related to the
      gestational age of the infant rather than to the exposure to either tocolytic
      agent.

TI  - Radiotherapy for Graves' orbitopathy: randomised placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 1505-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The best treatment (steroids, irradiation, or both) for moderately
      severe Graves' orbitopathy, a self-limiting disease is not known. We tested the
      efficacy of external beam irradiation compared with sham-irradiation. METHODS: In
      a double-blind randomised clinical trial, 30 patients with moderately severe
      Graves' orbitopathy had radiotherapy (20 Gy in ten fractions), and 30 were
      assigned sham-irradiation (ten fractions of 0 Gy). Treatment outcome was measured
      qualitatively by changes in major and minor criteria and quantitatively in
      several ophthalmic and other variables, such as eyelid aperture, proptosis, eye
      movements, subjective eye score, and clinical-activity score at 24 weeks.
      FINDINGS: The qualitative treatment outcome was successful in 18 of 30 (60%)
      irradiated patients versus nine of 29 (31%) sham-irradiated patients at week 24
      (relative risk [RR]=1.9 [95% CI 1.0-3.6], p=0.04). This difference was caused by 
      improvements in diplopia grade, but not by reduction of proptosis, nor of eyelid 
      swelling. Quantitatively, elevation improved significantly in the radiotherapy
      group, whereas all other variables remained unchanged. The field of binocular
      single vision was enlarged in 11 of 17 patients after irradiation compared with
      two of 15 after sham-irradiation. Nevertheless, only 25% of the irradiated
      patients were spared from additional strabismus surgery. INTERPRETATION: In these
      patients with moderately severe Graves' orbitopathy, radiotherapy should be used 
      only to treat motility impairment.

TI  - Ceruminolytic effects of docusate sodium: a randomized, controlled trial.
PG  - 228-32
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the tympanic membrane is often impeded by the
      presence of cerumen. We compared the ceruminolytic effects of triethanolamine
      polypeptide and docusate sodium in patients with cerumen. METHODS: We conducted a
      prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial on a convenience sample
      of cooperative adult and pediatric patients presenting to a university-based
      emergency department who required removal of cerumen to visualize the tympanic
      membrane. Structured data collection was performed, and the physician determined 
      whether visualization of the tympanic membrane was partially or totally obscured 
      by cerumen (interobserver agreement, rho=0.79). Patients received intra-aural
      instillation of 1mL of either docusate sodium or triethanolamine polypeptide in a
      liquid form. If not completely cleared within 15 minutes, the external ear canal 
      was irrigated with 50 or 100 mL of normal saline solution and additional attempts
      to visualize the tympanic membrane were made. The main outcome was the proportion
      of ears in which the tympanic membrane could be totally visualized after
      ceruminolytic instillation with or without irrigation. This study had 80% power
      to detect a 40% difference between groups in the proportion of totally visualized
      tympanic membranes (chi(2) test, alpha=.05). RESULTS: Of 50 enrolled patients, 23
      received triethanolamine polypeptide and 27 received docusate sodium. Mean
      patient age was 40 years (range 1 to 81 years); 35% were female. Groups were
      similar in age, sex, and proportion of completely obscured tympanic membranes at 
      presentation (78%). The ability to completely visualize the tympanic membrane was
      significantly greater after treatment with docusate sodium versus triethanolamine
      polypeptide (81% versus 35%; difference in proportions 47%; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 22 to 71) particularly in children aged 5 or less (90% versus 0%; 
      difference in proportions 89%; 95% CI 50 to 100). CONCLUSION: Docusate sodium
      solution is a more effective ceruminolytic than triethanolamine polypeptide,
      allowing complete or partial visualization of the tympanic membrane in most
      patients after a single application when followed with irrigation. Use of
      docusate sodium as a ceruminolytic should be encouraged, particularly in
      children.

TI  - Pacifier as a risk factor for acute otitis media: A randomized, controlled trial 
      of parental counseling.
PG  - 483-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between pacifier use and the increased
      occurrence of acute otitis media (AOM) in an intervention trial. METHODS:
      Fourteen well-baby clinics were selected to participate in an open, controlled
      cohort study. These clinics were paired according to the number of children and
      the social classes of the parents they served. One clinic in each pair was
      randomly allocated for an intervention, while the other served as a control. The 
      nurses at the intervention clinics were trained to instruct the parents of
      children <18 months old to limit pacifier use during their prescheduled visits to
      the clinic. The intervention consisted of a leaflet explaining the harmful
      effects of pacifier use and instructions to restrict its use. Two hundred
      seventy-two children were successfully recruited from the intervention clinics
      and 212 from the control clinics. The data about pacifier use and the occurrence 
      of respiratory infections and AOM were collected similarly in both groups.
      RESULTS: After the intervention, a 21% decrease was achieved in continuous
      pacifier use at the age of 7 to 18 months (P =.0001), and the occurrence of AOM
      per person-months at risk was 29% lower among children at the intervention
      clinics. The children who did not use a pacifier continuously in either of the
      clinics had 33% fewer AOM episodes than the children who did. CONCLUSION:
      Pacifier use appeared to be a preventable risk factor for AOM in children. Its
      restriction to the moments when the child was falling asleep effectively
      prevented episodes of AOM.

TI  - Inhaled nitric oxide reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 
      infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
PG  - 3722-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We previously reported improved oxygenation, but no change, in rates
      of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use or death among infants with
      persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn who received inhaled nitric
      oxide (NO) with conventional ventilation, irrespective of lung disease. The goal 
      of our study was to determine whether treatment with inhaled NO improves
      oxygenation and clinical outcomes in infants with persistent pulmonary
      hypertension of the newborn and associated lung disease who are ventilated with
      high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). DESIGN: Single-center,
      prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Newborn intensive care unit
      of a tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: We studied infants with a
      gestational age of > or =34 wks who were receiving mechanical ventilatory support
      and had echocardiographic and clinical evidence of pulmonary hypertension and
      hypoxemia (PaO2 < or =100 mm Hg on FIO2 = 1.0), despite optimal medical
      management Infants with congenital heart disease, diaphragmatic hernia, or other 
      major anomalies were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: The treatment group received
      inhaled NO, whereas the control group did not. Adjunct therapies and ECMO
      criteria were the same in the two groups of patients. Investigators and
      clinicians were not masked as to treatment assignment, and no crossover of
      patients was permitted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome variables 
      were mortality and use of ECMO. Secondary outcomes included change in oxygenation
      and duration of mechanical ventilatory support and supplemental oxygen therapy.
      Forty-two patients were enrolled. Baseline oxygenation and clinical
      characteristics were similar in the two groups of patients. Infants in the
      inhaled NO group (n = 21) had improved measures of oxygenation at 15 mins and 1
      hr after enrollment compared with infants in the control group (n = 20). Fewer
      infants in the inhaled NO group compared with the control group were treated with
      ECMO (14% vs. 55%, respectively; p = .007). Mortality did not differ with
      treatment assignment. CONCLUSIONS: Among infants ventilated by HFOV, those
      receiving inhaled NO had a reduced need for ECMO. We speculate that HFOV enhances
      the effectiveness of inhaled NO treatment in infants with persistent pulmonary
      hypertension of the newborn and associated lung disease.

TI  - Functional outcome of surgery for fractures of the ankle. A prospective,
      randomised comparison of management in a cast or a functional brace.
PG  - 246-9
AB  - We randomised prospectively 60 consecutive patients who were undergoing internal 
      fixation of similar fractures of the ankle into two groups, one of which was
      treated by immobilisation in a below-knee cast and the other by a functional
      brace with early movement. All were instructed to avoid weight-bearing on the
      affected side. They were seen at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. The functional rating
      scale of Mazur et al was used to evaluate the patients at each follow-up and we
      recorded the time of return to work. After one year the patients completed the
      SF-36 questionnaire. By then 55 patients remained in the study, 28 (mean age 45.5
      years) in group 1 and 27 (mean age 39.5 years) in group 2. Those in group 2 had
      higher functional scores at each follow-up but only at six weeks was this
      difference significant (p = 0.02). They also had higher mean SF-36 scores, but
      this difference was significant only for two of the eight aspects investigated.
      For patients gainfully employed, not on workers' compensation, the mean time from
      surgery to return to work was 53.3 days for group 2 and 106.5 days for group 1;
      this difference was significant (p = 0.01). No patient developed a problem with
      the wound or had loss of fixation. Our findings support the use of a functional
      brace and early movement after surgery for fractures of the ankle.

TI  - Randomized, controlled trial of glucosamine for treating osteoarthritis of the
      knee.
PG  - 91-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of glucosamine in reducing pain from
      osteoarthritis of the knee. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind parallel trial of
      glucosamine 500 mg three times daily or a placebo for 2 months. SETTING: Veterans
      Affairs Medical Center, Prescott, AZ. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-eight patients aged 34
      to 81 being treated for osteoarthritis of the knee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain
      intensity both at rest and while walking as assessed by a visual analog scale at 
      baseline and after 30 and 60 days of treatment. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were
      randomly allocated to each group. There was no statistical difference between the
      two groups in scores on the visual analog scale at 30 days for resting (mean [SD]
      score placebo group 3.5 [2.7] vs 3.3 [2.4] glucosamine group, P = 0.66) or
      walking (5.1 [2.6] vs 5.3 [2.4], P = 0.69); there was also no difference at 60
      days for resting (3.4 [2.5] vs 3.2 [2.5], P = 0.81) or walking (4.9 [2.2] vs 4.9 
      [2.8], P = 0.90). There was also no statistical difference between groups in the 
      mean change from baseline in scores on the visual analog scale (mean [SD] change 
      for walking at 60 days placebo group -1.5 [2.5] vs glucosamine group -1.4 [3.0], 
      P = 0.77). Two participants taking glucosamine and 4 taking placebo withdrew from
      the study due to adverse side effects (P = 0.67). CONCLUSION: Glucosamine was no 
      better than placebo in reducing pain from osteoarthritis of the knee in this
      group of patients.

TI  - Randomised comparison of the effectiveness and costs of community and hospital
      based mental health services for children with behavioural disorders.
PG  - 1047-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a community based intervention by
      secondary child and adolescent mental health services would be significantly more
      effective and less costly than a hospital based intervention. DESIGN: Open study 
      with two randomised parallel groups. SETTING: Two health districts in the north
      of England. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of 3 to 10 year old children with behavioural
      disorder who had been referred to child and adolescent mental health services.
      INTERVENTION: Parental education groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parents' and
      teachers' reports of the child's behaviour, parental depression, parental
      criticism of the child, impact of the child's behaviour on the family. RESULTS:
      141 subjects were randomised to community (n=72) or hospital (n=69) treatment.
      Primary outcome data were obtained on 115 (82%) cases a year later. Intention to 
      treat analyses showed no significant differences between the community and
      hospital based groups on any of the outcome measures, or on costs. Parental
      depression was common and predicted the child's outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Location of
      child mental health services may be less important than the range of services
      that they provide, which should include effective treatment for parents' mental
      health problems.

TI  - A comparison of a low-dose warfarin induction regimen with the modified Fennerty 
      regimen in elderly inpatients.
PG  - 31-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare a new low-dose warfarin induction regimen with the
      Fennerty regimen in elderly inpatients. DESIGN: Age-stratified, randomized
      prospective study. SUBJECTS: 120 age-stratified elderly inpatients.
      INTERVENTIONS: Each patient was randomized to either the new induction regimen or
      to a modified Fennerty regimen. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Days to therapeutic
      International Normalized Ratio (INR >2); days in the therapeutic range (INR 2-3) 
      during induction; number of patients with INR >4.5; ability of day 4 INR to
      predict day 8 warfarin dose. RESULTS: The mean time to therapeutic INR was longer
      for the new induction regimen than modified Fennerty regimen in patients aged
      65-75 years [4.6 (mean) +/- 1.6 (SD) days vs 3.8 +/- 0.8 days; P = 0.03] and in
      patients aged >75 years (4.5 +/- 1.4 days vs 3.5 +/- 0.7 days; P = 0.003).
      Patients spent more time in the therapeutic INR range with the new induction
      regimen [3.0 +/- 1.3 days vs 2.7 +/- 1.3 days (P = 0.03) for those aged 65-75
      years and 2.9 +/- 1.1 days vs 2.4 +/- 1.3 days (P = 0.04 for those aged >75
      years]. Fewer patients using the new regimen had INRs >4.5 in the first 8 days [1
      (3%) vs 6 (20%) for 65-75 years (P < 0.05) and 1 (3%) vs 11 (37%) for >75 years
      (P < 0.01)]. The ability to predict the maintenance dose to within 1 mg was 55%
      for both regimens. CONCLUSION: The low-dose regimen has important clinical
      advantages over the Fennerty regimen for anticoagulating elderly inpatients.

TI  - Delivery room management of the apparently vigorous meconium-stained neonate:
      results of the multicenter, international collaborative trial.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disagreement exists concerning the appropriate delivery room
      management of the airway of vigorous meconium-stained infants. Some suggest a
      universal approach to intubation and suctioning of the airway in all such
      neonates, whereas others advocate a selective approach. We performed this
      investigation: 1) to assess whether intubation and suctioning of apparently
      vigorous, meconium-stained neonates would reduce the incidence of meconium
      aspiration syndrome (MAS); and 2) to determine the frequency of complications
      from delivery room intubation and suctioning of such infants. METHODS: Inclusion 
      criteria included: 1) gestational age >/=37 weeks; 2) birth through
      meconium-stained amniotic fluid of any consistency; and 3) apparent vigor
      immediately after birth. Subjects were randomized to be intubated and suctioned
      (INT) or to expectant management (EXP). Primary outcome measures included: 1) the
      incidence of respiratory distress, including MAS, and 2) the incidence of
      complications from intubation. RESULTS: A total of 2094 neonates were enrolled
      from 12 participating centers (1051 INT and 1043 EXP). Meconium-stained amniotic 
      fluid consistency was similar in both groups. Of the 149 (7.1%) infants that
      subsequently demonstrated respiratory distress, 62 (3.0%) had MAS and 87 (4.2%)
      had findings attributed to other disorders. There were no significant differences
      between groups in the occurrence of MAS (INT = 3.2%; EXP = 2.7%) or in the
      development of other respiratory disorders (INT = 3.8%; EXP = 4.5%). Of 1098
      successfully intubated infants, 42 (3.8%) had a total of 51 complications of the 
      procedure. In all cases, the complications were mild and transient in nature.
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with expectant management, intubation and suctioning of the
      apparently vigorous meconium-stained infant does not result in a decreased
      incidence of MAS or other respiratory disorders. Complications of intubation are 
      infrequent and short-lived.

TI  - Comparison between the outer table and intracortical methods of obtaining
      autogenous bone graft from the iliac crest.
PG  - 1722-5
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study in two groups of patients selected randomly.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine whether keeping the outer and inner cortices of the
      ilium intact, while obtaining bone graft, would result in reduced postoperative
      bleeding and less postoperative pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Donor site
      complications after harvesting bone from the iliac crest are frequent. They
      comprise pain and bleeding related to the large bone exposed, injuries to the
      cluneal nerve, and sacroiliac instability. METHOD: Sixty patients who were
      admitted for elective fusion of lumbar segments were included in the study. In
      half of them, the iliac bone graft was taken in the outer Table method (group A),
      which included the outer cortex and the cancellous bone beneath, and in the
      remaining 30 patients only the cancellous bone from between the cortices was
      collected (group B). The amount of bone harvested, and the time taken to obtain
      it, were measured, as was the blood volume in the drains. At fixed intervals
      after surgery and up to 2 years thereafter, the patients were asked to grade the 
      severity of pain in their back and at the donor site. RESULTS: Two years after
      surgery, 22% of the patients in group A and 17% of the patients in group B
      reported to have significant pain at the donor site. This difference was not
      found to be statistically significant, nor was the postoperative bleeding. The
      average amount of bone harvested in group A was 36 grams compared with 25.7 grams
      in group B, taking 14 minutes and 20.3 minutes, respectively, to harvest it.
      These differences were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS:
      Preserving the iliac cortices, while obtaining bone graft, does not reduce the
      postoperative bleeding or the severity of pain at the donor site. In the
      intraosseous method, less bone is harvested and longer duration of surgery is
      required, compared with that of the outer Table method.

TI  - Relational Psychotherapy Mothers' Group: a developmentally informed intervention 
      for at-risk mothers.
PG  - 235-53
AB  - The Relational Psychotherapy Mothers' Group (RPMG), a developmentally informed,
      supportive psychotherapy designed to serve heroin-addicted mothers with children 
      up to 16 years of age, aims at addressing psychosocial vulnerabilities, and
      facilitating optimal parenting, among at-risk mothers. We present preliminary
      evidence on the efficacy of RPMG as an "add on" treatment in comparison with
      standard methadone counseling alone. At the end of the 24-week treatment period, 
      mothers receiving RPMG plus standard methadone counseling demonstrated lower
      levels of risk for child maltreatment, greater involvement with their children,
      and more positive psychosocial adjustment than women who received methadone
      counseling alone. Children of RPMG participants also reflected fewer problems in 
      multiple areas. At 6 months posttreatment, RPMG recipients continued to be at a
      relative advantage, although the magnitude of group differences was often
      attenuated. Notably, urinalyses indicated that RPMG mothers showed greater
      improvements in levels of opioid use over time than comparison mothers.

TI  - Prophylaxis of postoperative relapse in Crohn's disease with mesalamine: European
      Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study VI.
PG  - 264-73
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study investigated if long-term treatment with high-dose 
      mesalamine reduces the risk of clinical relapse of Crohn's disease after surgical
      resection. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter
      study, 4 g of mesalamine (Pentasa; Ferring A/S, Vanlose, Denmark) daily was
      compared with placebo in 318 patients. Treatment was started within 10 days after
      resective surgery and continued for 18 months. Primary outcome parameter was
      clinical relapse as defined by an increase in Crohn's Disease Activity Index,
      reoperation, septic complication, or newly developed fistula. Risk factors for
      recurrence were prospectively defined to be analyzed in a stepwise proportional
      hazards model. RESULTS: Cumulative relapse rates (+/-SE) after 18 months were
      24.5% +/- 3.6% and 31.4% +/- 3.7% in the mesalamine (n = 152) and placebo (n =
      166) groups, respectively (P = 0.10, log-rank test, 1-sided). Retrospective
      analysis showed a significantly reduced relapse rate with mesalamine only in a
      subgroup of patients with isolated small bowel disease (n = 124; 21.8% +/- 5.6%
      vs. 39.7% +/- 6.1%; P = 0.02, log-rank test). Probability of relapse was
      predominantly influenced by the duration of disease (P = 0.0006) and steroid
      intake before surgery (additional risk, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Eighteen months
      of mesalamine, 4 g daily, did not significantly affect the postoperative course
      of Crohn's disease. Some relapse-preventing effect was found in patients with
      isolated small bowel disease.

TI  - Undiluted albuterol aerosols in the pediatric emergency department.
PG  - E67
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of a short treatment method of
      administering albuterol aerosols. METHODS: Fifty children 6 to 18 years of age
      with severe acute asthma (peak flow rates <60% of predicted) were enrolled in a
      single-blind, controlled trial in an urban pediatric emergency department.
      Patients were randomized to receive either the study short treatment (3.5 mL of
      undiluted albuterol nebulized for 20 inhalations) or the control treatment
      (albuterol diluted [.5 mL] and nebulized in normal saline [3 mL]) every 20
      minutes for a total of 3 treatments. Peak flow and spirometric measurements were 
      performed before and after each treatment. RESULTS: There were 25 patients in the
      study group and 25 in the control group. There were no demographic differences
      between groups; both had comparable pulmonary function at presentation. The mean 
      forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted improvement between 0 and 
      60 minutes was 18.8% in the study group and 14.5% in the control group. The total
      time of treatment delivery for the study group was 6.4 minutes versus 32.7
      minutes for the control group. CONCLUSION: Undiluted albuterol short treatments
      seem to be as effective as standard diluted albuterol in severe asthmatics, while
      offering the ease and efficiency of shorter treatment administration time.

TI  - Hemodynamic effects of immunoadsorption and subsequent immunoglobulin
      substitution in dilated cardiomyopathy: three-month results from a randomized
      study.
PG  - 1590-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to assess the hemodynamic effects of
      immunoadsorption (IA) and subsequent immunoglobulin G (IgG) substitution in
      comparison with the effects of conventional medical treatment in patients with
      dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). BACKGROUND: Various circulating cardiac
      autoantibodies have been detected among patients suffering from DCM. These
      antibodies are extractable by IA. METHODS: Patients with DCM (n = 18, New York
      Heart Association III-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%) and who were
      on stable medication participated in the study. Hemodynamic measurements were
      performed using a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter. The patients were randomly
      assigned either to the treatment group with IA and subsequent IgG substitution
      (IA/IgG group, n = 9) or to the control group without IA/IgG (n = 9). In the
      IA/IgG group, the patients were initially treated in one IA session daily on
      three consecutive days. After the final IA session, 0.5 g/kg of polyclonal IgG
      was substituted. At one-month intervals, IA was then repeated for three further
      courses with one IA session daily on two consecutive days, until the third month.
      RESULTS: After the first IA course and IgG substitution, cardiac index (CI)
      increased from 2.1 (+/-0.1) to 2.8 (+/-0.1) L/min/m2 (p < 0.01) and stroke volume
      index (SVI) increased from 27.8 (+/-2.3) to 36.2 (+/-2.5) ml/m2 (p < 0.01).
      Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased from 1,428 (+/-74) to 997 (+/-55)
      dyne x s x cm(-5) (p < 0.01). The improvement in CI, SVI and SVR persisted after 
      three months. In contrast, hemodynamics did not change throughout the three
      months in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Immunoadsorption and subsequent IgG
      substitution improves cardiovascular function in DCM.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of intensive v. standard case management for severe psychotic 
      illness. UK700 case management trial. UK700 Group.
PG  - 537-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive case management is commonly advocated for the care of the
      severely mentally ill, but evidence of its cost-effectiveness is lacking. AIMS:
      To investigate the cost-effectiveness of intensive compared with standard case
      management for patients with severe psychosis. METHOD: 708 patients with
      psychosis and a history of repeated hospital admissions were randomly allocated
      to standard (case-loads 30-35) or intensive (case-loads 10-15) case management.
      Clinical and resource use data were assessed over two years. RESULTS: No
      statistically significant difference was found between intensive and standard
      case management in the total two-year costs of care per patient (means 24,550
      Pounds and 22,700 Pounds, respectively, difference 1850 Pounds, 95% CI--1600
      Pounds to 5300 Pounds). There was no evidence of differential effects in
      African-Caribbean patients or in the most disabled. Psychiatric in-patient
      hospital stay accounted for 47% of the total costs, but neither such
      hospitalisation nor other clinical outcomes differed between the randomised
      groups. CONCLUSION: Reduced case-loads have no clear beneficial effect on costs, 
      clinical outcome or cost-effectiveness. The policy of advocating intensive case
      management for patients with severe psychosis is not supported by these results.

TI  - Nicotine inhaler and nicotine patch as a combination therapy for smoking
      cessation: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 3128-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicotine replacement therapy is an effective treatment for
      nicotine-dependent smokers. However, cessation rates are modest, and preliminary 
      studies suggest that combination therapy may be superior. We compared the
      efficacy of the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch vs nicotine inhaler plus
      placebo patch for smoking cessation. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 400 subjects who had smoked 10 or more 
      cigarettes per day for 3 years or longer. Group 1 (n = 200) received the nicotine
      inhaler plus nicotine patch (delivering 15 mg of nicotine per 16 hours) for 6
      weeks, then inhaler plus placebo patch for 6 weeks, then inhaler alone for 14
      weeks. Group 2 (n = 200) received the nicotine inhaler plus placebo patch for 12 
      weeks, then inhaler for 14 weeks. Inhaler was used at a rate of 6 to 12
      cartridges per day ad libitum for 3 months and then tapered off. Main outcome
      measures were complete abstinence (self-reported) and expired carbon dioxide
      concentration less than 10 ppm. RESULTS: Group 1 vs group 2 complete abstinence
      rates were 60.5% and 47.5% at 6 weeks (P =.009), 42.0% and 31.0% at 12 weeks (P
      =.02), 25.0% and 22.5% at 6 months (P =.56), and 19.5% and 14.0% at 12 months (P 
      =. 14). One-year survival analysis showed a significant association between
      abstinence and treatment with nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch (P =.04). Mean
      nicotine substitution at week 6 was 60.1% (group 1) and 24.6% (group 2) (P<.001).
      At 12 months, the frequency of respiratory symptoms in abstinent subjects fell
      significantly and lung function showed a trend toward improvement. The most
      common adverse events were throat irritation (inhaler) and itching (patch).
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patch resulted in 
      significantly higher cessation rates than inhaler plus placebo patch.

TI  - Home or hospital for stroke rehabilitation? results of a randomized controlled
      trial : I: health outcomes at 6 months.
PG  - 1024-31
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We wished to examine the effectiveness of an early
      hospital discharge and home-based rehabilitation scheme for patients with acute
      stroke. METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled trial comparing early hospital
      discharge and home-based rehabilitation with usual inpatient rehabilitation and
      follow-up care. The trial was carried out in 2 affiliated teaching hospitals in
      Adelaide, South Australia. Participants were 86 patients with acute stroke (mean 
      age, 75 years) who were admitted to hospital and required rehabilitation.
      Forty-two patients received early hospital discharge and home-based
      rehabilitation (median duration, 5 weeks), and 44 patients continued with
      conventional rehabilitation care after randomization. The primary end point was
      self-reported general health status (SF-36) at 6 months after randomization. A
      variety of secondary outcome measures were also assessed. RESULTS: Overall,
      clinical outcomes for patients did not differ significantly between the groups at
      6 months after randomization, but the total duration of hospital stay in the
      experimental group was significantly reduced (15 versus 30 days; P<0.001).
      Caregivers among the home-based rehabilitation group had significantly lower
      mental health SF-36 scores (mean difference, 7 points). CONCLUSIONS: A policy of 
      early hospital discharge and home-based rehabilitation for patients with stroke
      can reduce the use of hospital rehabilitation beds without compromising clinical 
      patient outcomes. However, there is a potential risk of poorer mental health on
      the part of caregivers. The choice of this management strategy may therefore
      depend on convenience and costs but also on further evaluations of the impact of 
      stroke on caregivers.

TI  - A crossover study of triptorelin and leuprorelin acetate.
PG  - 299-305
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the potency, side effects, and duration of action of
      triptorelin and leuprorelin acetate after i.m. injections. DESIGN: Prospective,
      double-blind crossover clinical study. SETTING: A teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): 
      Fifty-four patients with pelvic endometriosis. INTERVENTION(S): Twenty-seven
      patients had three doses of i.m. triptorelin (3.75 mg) followed by three doses of
      i.m. leuprorelin acetate at 4-week intervals. Twenty-one patients had three doses
      of i.m. leuprorelin acetate (3.75 mg) followed by three doses of i.m.
      triptorelin, also at 4-week intervals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Menopausal
      symptoms, time taken for menstruation to return, serum E(2), FSH, LH levels,
      lipid profiles, and liver function tests. RESULT(S): The potencies of triptorelin
      and leuprorelin acetate in lowering the serum E(2), FSH, and LH levels were
      comparable. The severity of menopausal symptoms, changes in the lipid profile and
      liver function parameters were similar after triptorelin and leuprorelin acetate.
      The resurgence of ovarian activities and the spontaneous return of menstruation
      occurred significantly earlier after leuprorelin acetate than triptorelin.
      CONCLUSION(S): Both drugs are equally potent in down-regulating the
      pituitary-ovarian function, and their side effects are similar. Triptorelin has a
      longer duration of drug action and can be administered over a longer interval
      period.

TI  - Randomised prospective parallel trial of therapeutic versus subtherapeutic nasal 
      continuous positive airway pressure on simulated steering performance in patients
      with obstructive sleep apnoea.
PG  - 224-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) impairs vigilance and may lead to an
      increased rate of driving accidents. In uncontrolled studies accident rates and
      simulated steering performance improve following treatment with nasal continuous 
      positive airway pressure (NCPAP). This study seeks to confirm the improvement in 
      steering performance in a randomised controlled trial using subtherapeutic NCPAP 
      as a control treatment. METHODS: Fifty nine men with OSA (Epworth Sleepiness
      Score (ESS) of > or =10, and > or =10/h dips in SaO(2) of >4% due to OSA)
      received therapeutic or subtherapeutic NCPAP ( approximately 1 cm H(2)O) for one 
      month. Simulated steering performance over three 30-minute "drives" was
      quantified as: standard deviation (SD) of road position, deterioration in SD
      across the drive, length of drive before "crashing", and number of off-road
      events. The reaction times to peripheral target stimuli during the drive were
      also measured. RESULTS: Subtherapeutic NCPAP did not improve overnight >4% SaO(2)
      dips/h compared with baseline values, thus acting as a control. The SD of the
      steering position improved from 0.36 to 0.21 on therapeutic NCPAP, and from 0.35 
      to 0.30 on subtherapeutic NCPAP (p = 0.03). Deterioration in SD of the steering
      position improved from 0.18 to 0.06 SD/h with therapeutic NCPAP and worsened from
      0.18 to 0.24 with subtherapeutic NCPAP (p = 0.04). The reaction time to target
      stimuli was quicker after therapeutic than after subtherapeutic NCPAP (2.3 versus
      2.7 seconds, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic NCPAP improves steering
      performance and reaction time to target stimuli in patients with OSA, lending
      further support to the hypothesis that OSA impairs driving, increases driving
      accident rates, and that these improve following treatment with NCPAP.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of midwife led debriefing to reduce maternal
      depression after operative childbirth.
PG  - 1043-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a midwife led debriefing session during
      the postpartum hospital stay in reducing the prevalence of maternal depression at
      six months postpartum among women giving birth by caesarean section, forceps, or 
      vacuum extraction. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Large maternity 
      teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 1041 women who had given
      birth by caesarean section (n= 624) or with the use of forceps (n= 353) or vacuum
      extraction (n= 64). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal depression (score >/=13 on
      the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale) and overall health status (comparison
      of mean scores on SF-36 subscales) measured by postal questionnaire at six months
      postpartum. RESULTS: 917 (88%) of the women recruited responded to the outcome
      questionnaire. More women allocated to debriefing scored as depressed six months 
      after birth than women allocated to usual postpartum care (81 (17%) v 65 (14%)), 
      although this difference was not significant (odds ratio=1.24, 95% confidence
      interval 0.87 to 1.77). They were also more likely to report that depression had 
      been a problem for them since the birth, but the difference was not significant
      (123 (28%) v 94 (22%); odds ratio=1. 37, 1.00 to 1.86). Women allocated to
      debriefing had poorer health status on seven of the eight SF-36 subscales,
      although the difference was significant only for role functioning (emotional):
      mean scores 73.32 v 78.98, t= -2.31, 95% confidence interval -10.48 to -0.84).
      CONCLUSIONS: Midwife led debriefing after operative birth is ineffective in
      reducing maternal morbidity at six months postpartum. The possibility that
      debriefing contributed to emotional health problems for some women cannot be
      excluded.

TI  - Early dexamethasone-attempting to prevent chronic lung disease.
PG  - 542-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated improved survival and early outcomes in a 
      pilot trial of 2 doses of intravenous dexamethasone for infants with
      surfactant-treated respiratory distress syndrome. (1) A multicenter, randomized, 
      double-blind trial was undertaken to confirm these results. METHODS: Infants <30 
      weeks' gestation were eligible if they had respiratory distress syndrome,
      required mechanical ventilation at 12 to 18 hours of age, and had received at
      least 1 dose of exogenous surfactant. Infants were excluded if sepsis or
      pneumonia was suspected or if congenital heart disease or chromosomal
      abnormalities were present. A total of 384 infants were enrolled-189 randomized
      to dexamethasone (.5mg/kg birth weight at 12-18 hours of age and a second dose 12
      hours later) and 195 to an equal volume of saline placebo. RESULTS: No
      differences were found in the dexamethasone versus placebo groups, respectively, 
      regarding the primary outcomes of survival (79% vs 83%), survival without oxygen 
      at 36 weeks' corrected gestational age (CGA; both 59%), and survival without
      oxygen at 36 weeks' CGA and without late glucocorticoid therapy (46% vs 44%). No 
      significant differences between the groups in estimates from Kaplan-Meier
      survival analyses were found for median days on oxygen (50 vs 56 days),
      ventilation (20 vs 27 days), days to regain birth weight (15.5 vs 14 days), or
      length of stay (LOS; 88 vs 89 days). Infants given early dexamethasone were less 
      likely to receive later glucocorticoid therapy for bronchopulmonary dysplasia
      during their hospitalization (27% vs 35%). No clinically significant side effects
      were noted in the dexamethasone group, although there were transient elevations
      in blood glucose and blood pressure followed by a return to baseline by study day
      10. Among infants who died (40 vs 33), there were no differences in the median
      days on oxygen, ventilation, nor LOS. However, in survivors (149 vs 162), the
      following were observed: median days on oxygen 37 versus 45 days, ventilation 14 
      versus 19 days, and LOS 79 versus 81 days, for the dexamethasone versus placebo
      groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This dose of early intravenous dexamethasone
      did not reduce the requirement for oxygen at 36 weeks' CGA and survival was not
      improved. However, early dexamethasone reduced the use of later prolonged
      dexamethasone therapy, and among survivors, reduced the median days on oxygen and
      ventilation. We conclude that this course of early dexamethasone probably
      represents a near minimum dose for instituting a prophylactic regimen against
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

TI  - A prospective, randomized trial comparing flutamide (250 mg/d) and finasteride (5
      mg/d) in the treatment of hirsutism.
PG  - 984-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term (1 year) effects of flutamide (250 mg/d) and 
      finasteride (5 mg/d) for the treatment of hirsutism in women. DESIGN: Randomized,
      prospective clinical study. SETTING: Departments of Gynecology and Obstetrics and
      Endocrinology at Erciyes University Medical Faculty, Kayseri, Turkey. PATIENT(S):
      Seventy patients with hirsutism were studied. INTERVENTION(S): Thirty-five
      patients were treated with flutamide (250 mg/d) and 35 patients with finasteride 
      (5 mg/d) for 12 months. Hirsutism score, hormone levels, and multiscreen blood
      chemistry were measured at 3-month intervals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Reduction 
      in hair growth. RESULT(S): The modified Ferriman-Gallwey scores for hirsutism
      decreased significantly at months 6 and 12 from a mean +/- SD of 17. 8 +/- 5.8 to
      6.0 +/- 3.4 and 17.8 +/- 5.8 to 4.8 +/- 3.2, respectively, in group 1; and from
      19.1 +/- 6.1 to 14.2 +/- 4.9 and 19.1 +/- 6.1 to 11.3 +/- 5.0 in group 2,
      respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the
      hormonal indices in group 1, but in group 2, E(2) and sex hormone-binding
      globulin increased significantly while DHEAS decreased significantly at 12 months
      of therapy. CONCLUSION(S): This study shows that flutamide (250 mg/d) is more
      effective than finasteride (5 mg/d) in reducing hair growth. We conclude that
      flutamide (250 mg/d) may represent a more effective and well tolerated treatment 
      for patients.

TI  - Results of a randomized study of IM862 nasal solution in the treatment of
      AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
PG  - 716-23
AB  - PURPOSE: Although advances have been made in the treatment of AIDS-related
      Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) with systemic chemotherapy, less toxic therapies are
      needed. IM862 is a naturally occurring peptide with antiangiogenic properties and
      was thus studied in patients with AIDS-KS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IM862 was given 
      as intranasal drops at a dose of 5 mg. Patients were randomized to two dosing
      schedules given in repeated cycles until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity: 5 days of therapy followed by 5 days off (n = 18) and every other day
      dosing (n = 26). RESULTS: Forty-two male patients and two female patients with a 
      median age of 38 years (range, 22 to 53 years) were accrued. Twenty-one patients 
      (47%) had more than 50 mucocutaneous lesions, 14 (32%) had lymphedema, and none
      had visceral involvement. Thirty-three patients (75%) had received prior systemic
      chemotherapy. Twenty-four patients (55%) had CD4(+) lymphocyte count </=
      200/mm(3). All but five patients were being treated with concurrent protease
      inhibitor(s), for a median of 10 months (range, 0 to 24 months). Major responses 
      were documented in 36%, with five complete and 11 partial remissions, occurring
      after a median of 6 weeks (range, 3 to 26 weeks) and lasting a median of 33+
      weeks (range, 12+ to 95+ weeks). Twenty-one patients had stable disease for
      periods of 7 to 72+ weeks. Adverse effects to IM862 were limited to mild and
      transient headache, fatigue, tingling, and nausea. No hematologic adverse effects
      attributed to treatment were reported. CONCLUSION: IM862 given as intranasal
      drops is well tolerated and has antitumor activity in patients with AIDS-KS. A
      randomized double-blinded study to define the activity of IM862 in patients with 
      AIDS-KS is in progress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of calendar blister pack (CBP) use on glycemic
      and blood pressure control. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an 8-month 
      randomized controlled double-blind study among diabetic patients with poor
      glucose control (HbA1c >9.0%) in an urban area of South Auckland, New Zealand,
      with a high proportion of Maori and Pacific Islands people. Subjects included 68 
      consecutive patients, of whom 50% were prescribed three or more medications per
      day RESULTS: HbA1c was reduced by 0.95+/-0.22% in the CBP group and 0.15+/-0.25% 
      in the control group (P = 0.026). Diastolic blood pressure decreased 5.8+/-1.5 mm
      Hg in the CBP group and increased 0.1+/-1.9 mm Hg in the control group (P =
      0.0041). Systolic blood pressure did not change significantly CONCLUSIONS: CBPs
      should be considered among diabetic patients with poor glycemic control receiving
      multiple medications.

TI  - Effect of dietary patterns on serum homocysteine: results of a randomized,
      controlled feeding study.
PG  - 852-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated blood levels of homocysteine are associated with an
      increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although numerous
      studies have assessed the impact of vitamin supplements on homocysteine, the
      effect of dietary patterns on homocysteine has not been well studied. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: During a 3-week run-in, 118 participants were fed a control diet, low in
      fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with a fat content typical of US
      consumption. During an 8-week intervention phase, participants were then fed 1 of
      3 randomly assigned diets: the control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables
      but otherwise similar to control, or a combination diet rich in fruits,
      vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and reduced in saturated and total fat.
      Between the end of run-in and intervention periods, mean change in homocysteine
      was +0.46 micromol/L in the control diet, +0.21 micromol/L in the fruits and
      vegetables diet (P=0.47 compared with control), and -0.34 micromol/L in the
      combination diet (P=0.03 compared with control, P=0.12 compared with the fruits
      and vegetables diet). In multivariable regression models, change in homocysteine 
      was significantly and inversely associated with change in serum folate (P=0.03)
      but not with change in serum vitamin B(12) (P=0.64) or pyridoxal 5' phosphate,
      the coenzyme form of vitamin B(6) (P=0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Modification of dietary 
      patterns can have substantial effects on fasting levels of total serum
      homocysteine. These results provide additional insights into the mechanisms by
      which diet might influence the occurrence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of oseltamivir in treatment of acute influenza: a randomised 
      controlled trial. Neuraminidase Inhibitor Flu Treatment Investigator Group.
PG  - 1845-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of some antiviral drugs for influenza infection is limited by
      potential rapid emergence of resistance. We studied the efficacy and safety of
      oseltamivir, the oral prodrug of the neuraminidase inhibitor GS4071, in adults
      with naturally acquired laboratory-confirmed influenza. METHODS: We did a
      randomised controlled trial of 726 previously healthy non-immunised adults with
      febrile influenza-like illness of up to 36 h duration. Patients were assigned
      oral oseltamivir 75 mg (n=243), oseltamivir 150 mg (n=245), or placebo (n=238)
      twice daily for 5 days. We assessed recovery by questionnaire and temperature
      recordings. The primary endpoint was time to resolution of illness in
      influenza-infected patients. FINDINGS: 475 (66%) patients had confirmed
      infection. Duration of illness was significantly shorter by 29 h (25% reduction, 
      median duration 87.4 h [95% CI 73.3-104.7], p=0.02) with oseltamivir 75 mg and by
      35 h (30%, 81.8 h [68.2-100.0], p=0.01) with oseltamivir 150 mg than with placebo
      (116.5 h [101.5-137.8]). The effect of oseltamivir was apparent within 24 h of
      the start of treatment. In patients treated within 24 h of symptom onset,
      symptoms were alleviated 43 h (37% reduction) and 47 h (40%) earlier with
      oseltamivir 75 mg and 150 mg, respectively, compared with placebo (75 mg 74.5 h
      [68.2-98.0], p=0.02; 150 mg 70.7 h [54.0-89.4], p=0.01; placebo 117.5 h
      [103.0-143.8]). Oseltamivir was associated with lower [corrected] symptom scores,
      less viral shedding, and improved health, activity, and sleep quality, and was
      well tolerated. INTERPRETATION: Oseltamivir was effective and well tolerated in
      the treatment of natural influenza infection in adults. The efficacy,
      tolerability, and ease of administration warrant further investigation in
      children, elderly patients, and at-risk patients.

TI  - A prospective randomized study on bilateral carotid endarterectomy: patching
      versus eversion.
PG  - 119-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcome and restenosis incidence of patients
      who underwent carotid endarterectomy with patch closure (CEAP) on one side and
      carotid eversion endarterectomy (CEE) on the other. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:
      Although a few investigators have compared the results of CEAP versus CEE, no
      reports have compared the outcome of CEAP versus CEE in the same patient.
      METHODS: Eighty-six patients were randomly selected for sequential surgical
      treatment involving either CEAP/CEE or CEE/CEAP. All patients underwent
      postoperative duplex ultrasound study and clinical follow-up at 1, 6, and 12
      months and every year thereafter. Various factors were analyzed to ascertain any 
      association with restenosis, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the
      risk of restenosis. RESULTS: Demographic and clinical data were similar in the
      CEAP and CEE groups. The selective shunting rate was statistically higher in the 
      CEAP group. There were no perioperative deaths. Although the incidence of
      perioperative ipsilateral stroke was not significant, CEAP patients had a rate of
      combined transient ischemic attacks and strokes that approached statistical
      significance. The mean follow-up was 40 months. CEAP patients had a significantly
      higher incidence of restenosis and combined occlusive events and restenoses.
      Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CEE had a significantly better cumulative
      patency rate than CEAP and that freedom from restenoses at 24 and 36 months was
      87% and 83% for CEAP and 98% and 98% for CEE, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CEE is
      less likely to cause perioperative neurologic complications and restenoses than
      CEAP. The significantly higher rate of unilateral recurrence suggests that local 
      factors play a more important role than systemic factors in the occurrence of
      restenosis.

TI  - First-night effect of melatonin treatment in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 691-4
AB  - The first-night effect (FNE) is the tendency for individuals to sleep worse than 
      normal during their first night of polysomnographic sleep evaluation. FNE
      reflects the adaptive increase of alertness and perhaps the stress resulting from
      an unfamiliar sleeping environment. This effect is usually absent in patients
      with chronic schizophrenia. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine), the
      hormone secreted by the pineal gland at night, has been found to improve sleep in
      elderly patients with insomnia and recently in patients with chronic
      schizophrenia. The authors used FNE as a marker to explore the neurobehavioral
      responses of patients with chronic schizophrenia to melatonin treatment. In a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, 14 patients with chronic schizophrenia
      were administered melatonin (2 mg in a controlled-release formulation) or placebo
      for 3 weeks with a 1-week washout between treatment periods. Polysomnography was 
      performed during the last two consecutive nights of each treatment period. The
      following significant FNEs were observed with melatonin treatment: (1) rapid eye 
      movement sleep latency was longer; (2) sleep efficiency was lower; and (3) the
      duration of wakefulness during sleep was lower on the first night than on the
      second night. These effects were not found when the patients received a placebo. 
      The FNE was manifested regardless of whether melatonin was administered before or
      after the placebo treatment period. For the first time, these results show that
      melatonin treatment exaggerates FNE in patients with chronic schizophrenia,
      thereby suggesting an improved ability of these patients to mobilize alertness in
      unfamiliar surroundings.

TI  - Canadian implantable defibrillator study (CIDS) : a randomized trial of the
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator against amiodarone.
PG  - 1297-302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients surviving ventricular fibrillation (VF) or sustained
      ventricular tachycardia (VT) are at a high risk of death due to a recurrence of
      arrhythmia. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) terminates VT or VF,
      but it is not known whether this device prolongs life in these patients compared 
      with medical therapy with amiodarone. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 659
      patients with resuscitated VF or VT or with unmonitored syncope were randomly
      assigned to treatment with the ICD or with amiodarone. The primary outcome
      measure was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was arrhythmic death. 
      A total of 328 patients were randomized to receive an ICD. A thoracotomy was done
      in 33, no ICD was implanted in 18, and the rest had a nonthoracotomy ICD. All 331
      patients randomized to amiodarone received it initially. At 5 years, 85.4% of
      patients assigned to amiodarone were still receiving it at a mean dose of 255
      mg/day, 28.1% of ICD patients were also receiving amiodarone, and 21.4% of
      amiodarone patients had received an ICD. A nonsignificant reduction in the risk
      of death was observed with the ICD, from 10.2% per year to 8.3% per year (19.7%
      relative risk reduction; 95% confidence interval, -7.7% to 40%; P=0.142). A
      nonsignificant reduction in the risk of arrhythmic death was observed, from 4.5% 
      per year to 3.0% per year (32.8% relative risk reduction; 95% confidence
      interval, -7.2% to 57.8%; P=0.094). CONCLUSIONS: A 20% relative risk reduction
      occurred in all-cause mortality and a 33% reduction occurred in arrhythmic
      mortality with ICD therapy compared with amiodarone; this reduction did not reach
      statistical significance.

TI  - A 12-month comparative study of raloxifene, estrogen, and placebo on the
      postmenopausal endometrium.
PG  - 95-103
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a selective estrogen receptor modulator,
      raloxifene, on postmenopausal endometrium. METHODS: Healthy postmenopausal women 
      (n = 415) were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: 60 or 150
      mg/day raloxifene hydrochloride, 0.625 mg/day conjugated equine estrogens, or
      placebo, and treated for 1 year. Endometrial biopsies were obtained in a blinded 
      fashion at baseline and every 6 months after the ultrasound studies. Transvaginal
      ultrasound, with uterine size measurements, was done at baseline and at 3-month
      intervals. Saline-infusion sonohysterography was done at baseline and every 6
      months. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in baseline 
      characteristics. Mean endometrial thickness, measured by transvaginal ultrasound,
      was unchanged from baseline to end point in the placebo and raloxifene groups,
      whereas in the estrogen group it was significantly thicker by 5.5 mm (P < .001). 
      Mean uterine volume, calculated from transvaginal ultrasound measurements, was
      higher in the estrogen group only (22 cm3, P < .001). Of the 358 women with
      paired biopsies, endometrial hyperplasia was present in 2.1%, 0%, and 26.1% of
      the end-point biopsies in the placebo, raloxifene, and estrogen groups,
      respectively (P < .001). Proliferative endometrium was present in 2.1% of the
      end-point biopsies in the placebo group, 1.7% in the combined raloxifene groups, 
      and 39.8% in the estrogen group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Raloxifene, at 60 or 150 
      mg/day for 1 year, did not stimulate the postmenopausal endometrium. End-point
      endometrial thickness, morphology, and uterine volume in the raloxifene groups
      were similar to those observed at baseline and in the placebo group.

TI  - Nefazodone treatment of major depression in alcohol-dependent patients: a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 129-36
AB  - Depression is the most common comorbid psychiatric illness in patients with
      alcohol dependence. This double-blind study tested the efficacy of nefazodone
      versus placebo for the treatment of depression in actively drinking
      alcohol-dependent patients who were also participating in weekly group treatment 
      for alcoholism. Sixty-four subjects with major depression disorder and alcohol
      dependence with a history of at least one prior episode of depression when not
      drinking were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of either nefazodone or
      placebo and participated in a weekly psychoeducational group on alcoholism.
      Subjects were assessed every 2 weeks for depression, anxiety, side effects, and
      drinking frequency. Subjects taking nefazodone were significantly more likely to 
      complete the study (62%) than those taking placebo (34%). Analyses of covariance 
      using drinks per week as a time-dependent covariate showed lower Hamilton Rating 
      Scale for Depression scores at week 8 for end-point analysis and at weeks 8 and
      12 for completers. The endpoint analysis demonstrated a significantly greater
      response in the nefazodone group (48%) than in the placebo group (16%). Both
      groups showed a similarly significant decrease in the average number of alcoholic
      drinks consumed per day over the course of the study. Although the number of
      adverse effects was significantly greater for the nefazodone group, there were no
      severe adverse events, and nefazodone was well tolerated. Nefazodone is a safe
      and effective antidepressant to use in a population of alcohol-dependent patients
      with depression who have a high degree of comorbidity. Nefazodone treatment was
      superior to placebo in alleviating depression in these patients but did not add
      any advantage over the psychoeducational group in terms of drinking outcomes.

TI  - Correlates of immune protection induced by live, attenuated, cold-adapted,
      trivalent, intranasal influenza virus vaccine.
PG  - 1133-7
AB  - The authors conducted a 2-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      efficacy field trial of live, attenuated, cold-adapted, trivalent influenza
      vaccine administered by nasal spray to children 15-71 months old. Overall,
      vaccine was 92% efficacious at preventing culture-confirmed infection by
      influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B. Because influenza A/H1N1 did not cause disease 
      during the years in which this study was conducted, the authors sought to
      determine vaccine efficacy and correlates of immune protection against
      experimental challenge with 107 TCID50 of attenuated H1N1 (vaccine strain) by
      intranasal spray. Prechallenge assessments included serum
      hemaglutination-inhibiting (HAI) antibody and nasal wash IgA antibody to H1N1.
      Vaccine was 83% efficacious (95% confidence interval, 60%-93%) at preventing
      shedding of H1N1 virus after challenge. Any serum HAI antibody or any nasal wash 
      IgA antibody was correlated with significant protection from H1N1 infection as
      indicated by vaccine-virus shedding, and high efficacy against H1N1 challenge was
      demonstrated.

TI  - Electromagnetic versus fluoroscopic mapping of the inferior isthmus for ablation 
      of typical atrial flutter: A prospective randomized study.
PG  - 2082-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency catheter ablation within the tricuspid
      annulus-inferior caval vein isthmus can cure typical atrial flutter. The target
      for ablation, nonetheless, is relatively wide, and standard ablation procedures
      may require significant exposure to radiation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 50
      patients (mean age, 58+/-11 years) with typical atrial flutter were prospectively
      randomized to receive isthmus ablation using conventional fluoroscopy for
      catheter navigation (group I, n=24) or electromagnetic mapping (group II, n=26). 
      Complete bidirectional isthmus block was verified with double potential mapping. 
      If complete isthmus block could not be achieved after 20 radiofrequency pulses or
      25 minutes of fluoroscopy, the patients were switched to the other group. Eight
      patients from group I (33%) but only 1 patient from group II (4%) were switched. 
      Overall, complete isthmus block was achieved in 47 of 50 patients (94%). The
      overall fluoroscopy time, including the placement of the diagnostic catheters,
      was 22.0+/-6.3 minutes in group I and 3.9+/-1.5 minutes in group II (P:<0.0001). 
      The fluoroscopy time needed for isthmus mapping was 17.7+/-6.5 minutes in group I
      and 0.2+/-0.3 minutes in group II (P:<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Electromagnetic
      mapping during the induction of linear lesions for the ablation of atrial flutter
      permitted a highly significant reduction in exposure to fluoroscopy while
      maintaining high efficacy, and it allowed the time required for fluoroscopy to be
      reduced to levels anticipated for diagnostic electrophysiological studies.

TI  - Physiotherapy for anterior knee pain: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 700-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of the individual components of
      physiotherapy in subjects with anterior knee pain. METHODS: An observer blind,
      prospective, factorial design randomised controlled trial. 81 young adults with
      anterior knee pain were randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: (1)
      exercise, taping, and education; (2) exercise and education; (3) taping and
      education; and (4) education alone. Each group received six physiotherapist-led
      treatments over three months. Follow up took place at three months using the
      following outcome measures: patient satisfaction (discharge/refer for further
      treatment); a visual analogue pain score; the WOMAC lower limb function score;
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD); and quadriceps strength. At 12
      months the WOMAC and HAD were assessed by postal questionnaire. RESULTS: All
      groups showed significant improvements in WOMAC, visual analogue, and HAD scores;
      these improvements did not vary significantly between the four groups or between 
      exercising/non-exercising and taped/non-taped patients at three and 12 months.
      However, patients who exercised were significantly more likely to be discharged
      at three months than non-exercising patients (chi(2), p<0.001). Taping was not
      significantly associated with discharge. Significantly greater improvements in
      WOMAC, visual analogue, and the anxiety score (but not the depression score) were
      seen in patients who were discharged than in those who were referred.
      CONCLUSIONS: The proprioceptive muscle stretching and strengthening aspects of
      physiotherapy have a beneficial effect at three months sufficient to permit
      discharge from physiotherapy. These benefits are maintained at one year. Taping
      does not influence the outcome.

TI  - A randomized trial of oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy on bone 
      mineral density and coronary heart disease risk factors in postmenopausal women.
PG  - 87-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the effects of oral contraceptive (OC) and hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) on bone mineral density and coronary heart disease risk
      factors in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Eighty healthy postmenopausal women
      were randomly assigned to a cyclic regimen of OC containing 30 microg of ethinyl 
      estradiol and 150 microg of desogestrel or HRT containing 0.625 mg of conjugated 
      equine estrogens 21 days per cycle and 5 mg of medrogestone 10 days per cycle for
      12 months. Bone mineral density of lumbar spine and hip, biochemical markers of
      bone turnover, lipid-lipoprotein profiles, coagulation profiles, fasting plasma
      glucose, and blood pressure were evaluated. RESULTS: Both regimens caused
      significant increase in bone mineral density of lumbar spine, trochanter,
      intertrochanteric region, total hip, and Ward triangle. Only OC therapy was
      associated with a significant increase in femoral neck bone mineral density (mean
      score +/- standard error 2.5% +/- 0.7%, P < .01). Biochemical markers of bone
      turnover, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased
      significantly in both groups. Posttreatment levels of those bone markers and
      lipid-lipoprotein were significantly lower after OC therapy than HRT. Fasting
      plasma glucose and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in both
      groups; however, only the OC group showed a significant decrease in diastolic
      blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Both OC and HRT increased bone mineral density of
      lumbar spine and hip, but OC suppressed bone turnover more than HRT. Both methods
      favorably affected lipid-lipoprotein metabolism, fasting plasma glucose, and
      blood pressure during the 12 months of treatment.

TI  - Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor after intensive consolidation chemotherapy 
      in acute myeloid leukemia: results of a randomized trial of the Groupe Ouest-Est 
      Leucemies Aigues Myeloblastiques.
PG  - 780-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Ten years after the first clinical studies, the clinical impact of
      myeloid growth factors in acute myeloid leukemia is still unclear. One of the
      objectives of the Groupe Ouest-Est Leucemies Aigues Myeloblastiques (GOELAM) 2
      trial was to evaluate the benefit of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)
      given only after the two courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy (ICC)
      used to maintain complete remission (CR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred
      ninety-four patients who were in CR after induction treatment were randomly
      assigned to receive G-CSF (100 patients) or no G-CSF (94 patients) after two
      courses of ICC (ICC 1, high-dose cytarabine plus mitoxantrone; ICC 2, amsacrine
      plus etoposide). G-CSF (filgrastim) was administered from the day after
      chemotherapy until granulocyte recovery at a daily dose of 5 microg/kg. RESULTS: 
      In the G-CSF group, the median duration of neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/L) was
      dramatically reduced, both after ICC 1 (12 v 19 days, P <.001) and after ICC 2
      (20 v 28 days, P <.001). The median duration of hospitalization was also
      significantly shorter in the G-CSF group (24 v 27 days after ICC 1, P <.001; 29 v
      34 days after ICC 2, P <. 001). The median duration of intravenous antibiotics
      was significantly reduced after ICC 1 and ICC 2, and the median duration of
      antifungal therapy was significantly reduced after ICC 1. However, the incidence 
      of microbiologically documented infections, the toxic death rate, the 2-year
      disease-free survival, and the 2-year overall survival were not affected by G-CSF
      administration. Moreover, the median interval between ICC1 and ICC2 was reduced
      by only 2 days, and the number of patients undergoing ICC2 was not increased in
      the G-CSF arm. CONCLUSION: G-CSF should be administered routinely after ICC to
      reduce the duration of neutropenia and hospitalization. However, G-CSF did not
      seem to significantly increase the feasibility of this two-course program or
      modify overall outcome.

      Study Team.
PG  - 1888-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chloroquine plus proguanil is widely used for malaria
      chemoprophylaxis despite low effectiveness in areas where multidrug-resistant
      malaria occurs. Studies have shown that atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride is
      safe and effective for prevention of falciparum malaria in lifelong residents of 
      malaria-endemic countries, but little is known about non-immune travellers.
      METHODS: In a double-blind equivalence trial, 1083 participants travelling to a
      malaria-endemic area were randomly assigned to two treatment groups:
      atovaquone-proguanil plus placebos for chloroquine and proguanil, or chloroquine,
      proguanil, and placebo for atovaquone-proguanil. Follow-up was by telephone 7 and
      60 days after travel and at a clinic at 28 days. Serum samples were tested for
      antibodies to a malaria circumsporozoite protein. Blood and serum samples of
      participants with a potential malaria diagnosis were tested in a reference
      laboratory. FINDINGS: 7 days after travel, at least one adverse event was
      reported by 311 (61%) of 511 participants who received atovaquone-proguanil and
      329 (64%) of 511 who received chloroquine-proguanil. People receiving
      atovaquone-proguanil had a lower frequency of treatment-related gastrointestinal 
      adverse events (59 [12%] vs 100 [20%], p=0.001), and of treatment-related adverse
      events of moderate or severe intensity (37 [7%] vs 56 [11%], p=0.05). There were 
      fewer treatment-related adverse events that caused prophylaxis to be discontinued
      in the atovaquone-proguanil group than in the chloroquine-proguanil group (one
      [0.2%] vs ten [2%], p=0.015). INTERPRETATION: Overall the two preparations were
      similarly tolerated. However, significantly fewer adverse gastrointestinal events
      were observed in the atovaquone-proguanil group in than in the
      chloroquine-proguanil group.

TI  - Amantadine in the treatment of cocaine-dependent patients with severe withdrawal 
      symptoms.
PG  - 2052-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study examined the effectiveness of amantadine in reducing cocaine
      withdrawal symptoms and improving treatment outcome among cocaine-dependent
      patients in outpatient treatment. METHOD: Sixty-one cocaine-dependent subjects
      participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of amantadine. RESULTS: 
      Among subjects with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms at the start of treatment,
      those who received amantadine used significantly less cocaine during the trial
      than did subjects who received placebo. Compared to subjects who received
      placebo, subjects who received amantadine submitted significantly more
      benzoylecgonine-negative urine samples and used cocaine on significantly fewer
      days during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Amantadine may be an effective treatment for 
      cocaine-dependent patients with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms.

TI  - Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural family intervention in reducing the burden
      of care in carers of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 557-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease live outside
      institutions and there is considerable serious psychological morbidity among
      their carers. AIMS: To evaluate whether family intervention reduces the
      subjective burden of care in carers of patients with Alzheimer's disease and
      produces clinical benefits in the patients. METHOD: A prospective single-blind
      randomised controlled trial with three-month follow-up in which the experimental 
      group received family intervention and was compared with two control groups.
      RESULTS: There were significant reductions in distress and depression in the
      intervention group compared with control groups at post-treatment and follow-up. 
      There were significant reductions in behavioural disturbance at post-treatment
      and an increase in activities at three months in patients in the intervention
      group. Based on an improvement on the General Health Questionnaire resulting in a
      carer converting from a case to a non-case, the number to treat was three
      immediately post-treatment and two at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Family intervention
      can have significant benefits in carers of patients with Alzheimer's disease and 
      has a positive impact on patient behaviour.

TI  - Clinical pathway for fractured neck of femur: a prospective, controlled study.
PG  - 423-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes of using a clinical pathway for managing patients
      with fractured neck of femur. DESIGN: Prospective, pseudorandomised, controlled
      trial. SETTING: St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria (a tertiary referral, 
      university teaching hospital), 1 October 1997 to 30 November 1998. PARTICIPANTS: 
      111 patients (80 women and 31 men; mean age, 81 years) admitted via the emergency
      department with a primary diagnosis of fractured neck of femur. INTERVENTIONS:
      Management guided by a clinical pathway (55 patients) or established standard of 
      care (control group, 56 patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Timing of referrals and
      discharge planning; total length of stay; and complication and readmission rates 
      within 28 days of discharge. RESULTS: Patients managed according to the clinical 
      pathway had a shorter total stay (6.6 versus 8.0 days; P = 0.03), even if
      assessment for placement by the Aged Care Assessment Service was required (9.5
      versus 13.6 days; P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in
      complication and readmission rates between pathway and control patients
      (complication rates, 24% versus 36%; P = 0.40; readmission rates, 4% versus 11%; 
      P = 0.28). CONCLUSION: Coordinated multidisciplinary care of patients with
      fractured neck of femur reduces length of stay without increasing complications.

      reduced pain, joint swelling, time of immobilization, duration of sick leave and 
      return to sports after the arthroscopic procedure. In the treatment group, 1
      patient had transitory purulent arthritis requiring antibiotics and arthroscopic 
      synovectomy occurred.

TI  - Atrial pacing for the prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiovascular
      surgery.
PG  - 1416-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of atrial
      pacing in the prevention of atrial fibrillation following cardiovascular surgery.
      BACKGROUND: Although pharmacologic therapy has been used to help prevent
      postoperative atrial fibrillation, it suffers from limited efficacy and adverse
      effects. In the nonoperative setting, novel pacing strategies have been shown to 
      reduce recurrences of atrial fibrillation and prolong arrhythmia-free periods in 
      patients with paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias. METHODS: A total of 154 patients
      (115 men; mean age, 65 +/- 10 years; ejection fraction, 53 +/- 10%) undergoing
      cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass surgery, 88.3%; aortic valve replacement,
      4.5%; coronary bypass + aortic valve replacement, 7.1%) had right and left atrial
      epicardial pacing electrodes placed at the time of surgery. Patients were
      randomized to either no pacing, right atrial (RAP), left atrial (LAP) or biatrial
      pacing (BAP) for 72 h after surgery. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents were
      administered concurrently to all patients following surgery. RESULTS: There was a
      reduction in the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation from 37.5% in
      patients receiving no postoperative pacing to 17% (p < 0.005) in patients
      assigned to one of the three pacing strategies. The length of hospital stay was
      reduced by 22% from 7.8 +/- 3.7 days to 6.1 +/- 2.3 days (p = 0.003) in patients 
      assigned to postoperative atrial pacing. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was
      lower in each of the paced groups (RAP, 8%; LAP, 20%; BAP, 26%) compared with
      patients who did not receive postoperative pacing (37.5%). CONCLUSION:
      Postoperative atrial pacing, in conjunction with beta-blockade, significantly
      reduced both the incidence of atrial fibrillation and the length of hospital stay
      following cardiovascular surgery. Additional studies are needed to determine the 
      most effective anatomic pacing site.

TI  - Stiripentol in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy: a randomised
      placebo-controlled syndrome-dedicated trial. STICLO study group.
PG  - 1638-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiripentol is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 that showed
      antiepileptic efficacy in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI) in
      association with clobazam and valproate in an open study. To confirm these
      results, 41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled,
      add-on trial. METHODS: After a baseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or
      stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam during a double-blind
      period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion.
      Responders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of
      clonic (or tonic-clonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind
      period compared with baseline. FINDINGS: 15 (71%) patients were responders on
      stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic seizures), whereas
      there was only one (5%) on placebo (none were seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI
      52.1-90.7 vs placebo 0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7.
      Percentage of change from baseline was higher on stiripentol (-69%) than on
      placebo (+7%), p<0.0001. 21 patients on stiripentol had moderate side-effects
      (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, but side-effects
      disappeared when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases.
      INTERPRETATION: This controlled trial shows the antiepileptic efficacy, of add-on
      stiripentol in children with SMEI. The results also provide good reason to focus 
      studies on a specific epilepsy syndrome-a small sample of patients is sufficient 
      to show the efficacy that might have been missed in a heterogeneous population.

TI  - Neonatal effects of nifedipine and ritodrine for preterm labor.
PG  - 477-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared nifedipine and ritodrine for treatment of preterm labor
      with respect to neonatal outcome. METHODS: We conducted an open randomized
      multicenter study of neonatal outcome in 185 women who received either oral
      nifedipine (n = 95) or intravenous (IV) ritodrine (n = 90) for treatment of
      preterm labor. Secondary outcome measures included neonatal mortality and
      morbidity, especially neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, respiratory 
      distress syndrome (RDS), and intracranial bleeding. RESULTS: There were no
      significant differences in umbilical artery pH values and Apgar scores between
      groups. Nifedipine was associated with lower admission rates to the NICU (49%
      versus 66%; odds ratio 0. 51, confidence interval 0.28, 0.93) compared with
      ritodrine, and lower incidences of RDS (21% versus 37%; 0.46, 0.24, 0.89),
      intracranial bleeding (18% versus 31%; 0.48, 0.24, 0.96), and neonatal jaundice
      (52% versus 67%; 0.53, 0.29, 0.97). Logistic regression analysis showed that even
      after correction for gestational age at birth, newborn risk of RDS, intracranial 
      bleeding, or neonatal jaundice was significantly lower in the nifedipine group
      than the ritodrine group. CONCLUSION: Nifedipine for treatment of preterm labor
      was associated with a lower incidence of neonatal morbidity than ritodrine. That 
      difference appeared to be partly because of the higher tocolytic efficacy of
      nifedipine and partly because of an intrinsic beneficial effect of nifedipine, or
      the lack of harmful effects when compared with ritodrine.

TI  - Evaluation of HIV-1 immunogen, an immunologic modifier, administered to patients 
      infected with HIV having 300 to 549 x 10(6)/L CD4 cell counts: A randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 2193-202
AB  - CONTEXT: Despite enormous improvements achieved through the use of antiretroviral
      therapies (ARTs), the risk for eventual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      disease progression remains high. Agents that enhance the immunologic mechanism
      for viral recognition might reduce disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To determine
      whether the addition of HIV-1 Immunogen would confer added clinical efficacy to
      that achievable by ARTs. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicenter, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized trial beginning March 1996 and ending May 1999
      conducted at 77 centers in the United States providing primary care or referral
      care for persons infected with HIV. PATIENTS: Adults infected with HIV who have
      baseline CD4 cell counts between 300 x 10(6)/L and 549 x 10(6)/L without prior
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining conditions receiving stable ART (or
      no therapy) were screened and 2527 were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: Ten units of
      HIV-1 Immunogen, derived from a Zairian HIV isolate, inactivated and formulated
      with incomplete Freund adjuvant, was administered intramuscularly every 12 weeks.
      The placebo was incomplete Freund adjuvant. Changes in ARTs were allowed. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV progression-free survival; secondary end points included
      overall survival, changes in HIV RNA, CD4 cell counts, CD4 percentage, body
      weight, and immunogenicity. RESULTS: The overall event rate was 1.8 per 100
      person-years of follow-up. Fifty-three subjects developed clinical progression in
      each treatment group (relative risk [RR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.66-1.42; P =.89). There were 19 and 23 deaths in the placebo and HIV-1
      Immunogen groups, respectively (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.44-1. 48; P =.49). There were
      no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to
      changes in HIV RNA (P =.59), CD4 percentage (P =.63), or body weight (P =.89).
      Subjects in the HIV-1 Immunogen group had an increase in average CD4 cell count
      of approximately 10 x 10(6)/L greater than the placebo group (P =.02).
      CONCLUSION: HIV-1 Immunogen with unrestricted ART failed to demonstrate an
      increase in HIV progression-free survival. JAMA. 2000;284:2193-2202.

TI  - Rizatriptan in the treatment of menstrual migraine.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of oral rizatriptan 10 mg and 5 mg for
      treating menstrually associated migraine attacks. METHODS: Data from two large
      clinical trials with identical designs were included in a retrospective analysis.
      The studies were randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, incomplete block,
      two-period, crossover designs. Women with migraines were randomly assigned to one
      of five treatment sequences for the treatment of two migraine attacks. Only data 
      from the first attack in women with migraines who were treated with rizatriptan
      or placebo were included in the analysis. A menstrually associated attack was
      defined as one that occurred within 3 days before or after the onset of the last 
      menstrual period. RESULTS: In the subgroup of 335 women with menstrually
      associated migraine, rizatriptan was effective compared with placebo. At 2 hours 
      after dosing, 68% of 139 women taking rizatriptan 10 mg and 70% of 115 women
      taking rizatriptan 5 mg with a menstrually associated migraine had pain relief
      compared with 44% of 81 patients taking placebo (P <.05). In all women,
      rizatriptan was as effective in treating menstrual as well as nonmenstrual
      migraine: 68% of 139 patients taking rizatriptan 10 mg with a menstrually
      associated migraine had pain relief at 2 hours after dosing compared with 69% of 
      393 patients with nonmenstrually associated attacks (test of menstrual
      association = nonsignificant; the analysis had 80% power to detect a difference
      of six percentage points between groups). Similar results were found for
      rizatriptan 5 mg (menstrual = 70%, nonmenstrual = 66%; not statistically
      significant). CONCLUSION: Rizatriptan is effective in the treatment of
      menstrually associated migraine attacks.

PG  - 1557-61
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of human herpesvirus
      (HHV)-7 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and the effects of oral and intravenous
      (iv) ganciclovir in renal transplant recipients at risk for CMV. Stored lysates
      from peripheral blood leukocytes from 92 patients, who had been previously
      analyzed for CMV viremia by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 12 weeks after
      transplantation, were analyzed for HHV-7 viremia. Baseline and peak prevalences
      of HHV-7 viremia were 22% and 54%, respectively (P<. 0001). Eighty-two (89%) of
      92 patients had at least 1 positive PCR for HHV-7. Oral ganciclovir and treatment
      with iv ganciclovir had no effect on the prevalence of HHV-7 viremia. In
      contrast, CMV was almost completely suppressed in patients who received oral
      ganciclovir, and when present, CMV responded to iv therapy. These results
      indicate that HHV-7 is resistant to ganciclovir at levels that were effective for
      prevention and treatment of CMV.

TI  - Decreasing sedentary behaviors in treating pediatric obesity.
PG  - 220-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown television watching to be a risk
      factor for the development of obesity in children. The effect of reducing
      television watching and other sedentary behaviors as a component of a
      comprehensive obesity treatment program has not been thoroughly tested.
      OBJECTIVE: To compare the influence of targeting decreases in sedentary behavior 
      vs. increases in physical activity in the comprehensive treatment of obesity in
      8- to 12-year-old children. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled outcome study.
      SETTING: Childhood obesity research clinic. DESIGN: Ninety families with obese 8-
      to 12-year-old children were randomly assigned to groups that were provided a
      comprehensive family-based behavioral weight control program that included
      dietary, and behavior change information but differed in whether sedentary or
      physically active behaviors were targeted and the degree of behavior change
      required. RESULTS: Results during 2 years showed that targeting either decreased 
      sedentary behaviors or increased physical activity was associated with
      significant decreases in percent overweight and body fat and improved aerobic
      fitness. Self-reported activity minutes increased and targeted sedentary time
      decreased during treatment. Children substituted nontargeted sedentary behaviors 
      for some of their targeted sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSION: These results support
      reducing sedentary behaviors as an adjunct in the treatment of pediatric obesity.

TI  - Radiotherapy in breast-conserving treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ: first
      results of the EORTC randomised phase III trial 10853. EORTC Breast Cancer
      Cooperative Group and EORTC Radiotherapy Group.
PG  - 528-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a disorder that has 
      become more common since it may manifest as microcalcifications that can be
      detected by screening mammography. Since selected women with invasive cancer can 
      be treated safely with breast conservation therapy it is paradoxical that total
      mastectomy has remained the standard treatment for DCIS. We did a randomised
      phase III clinical trial to investigate the role of radiotherapy after complete
      local excision of DCIS. METHODS: Between 1986 and 1996, women with clinically or 
      mammographically detected DCIS measuring less than or equal to 5 cm were treated 
      by complete local excision of the lesion and then randomly assigned to either no 
      further treatment (n=503) or to radiotherapy (n=507; 50 Gy in 5 weeks to the
      whole breast). The median duration of follow-up was 4.25 years (maximum 12.0
      years). All analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 500 patients were
      followed up in the no further treatment group and 502 in the radiotherapy group. 
      In the no further treatment group 83 women had local recurrence (44 recurrences
      of DCIS, and 40 invasive breast cancer). In the radiotherapy group 53 women had
      local recurrences (29 recurrences of DCIS, and 24 invasive breast cancer). The
      4-year local relapse-free was 84% in the group treated with local excision alone 
      compared with 91% in the women treated by local excision plus radiotherapy (log
      rank p=0.005; hazard ratio 0.62). Similar reductions in the risk of invasive
      (40%, p=0.04) and non-invasive (35%, p=0.06) local recurrence were seen.
      CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy after local excision for DCIS, as compared with local
      excision alone, reduced the overall number of both invasive and non-invasive
      recurrences in the ipsilateral breast at a median follow-up of 4.25 years.

TI  - Results at 1 year of outpatient multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation: a
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 362-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation seems to be an effective intervention in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We undertook a randomised
      controlled trial to assess the effect of outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation on
      use of health care and patients' wellbeing over 1 year. METHODS: 200 patients
      with disabling chronic lung disease (the majority with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease) were randomly assigned a 6-week multidisciplinary
      rehabilitation programme (18 visits) or standard medical management. Use of
      health services was assessed from hospital and general-practice records. Analysis
      was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: There was no difference between the
      rehabilitation (n=99) and control (n=101) groups in the number of patients
      admitted to hospital (40 vs 41) but the number of days these patients spent in
      hospital differed significantly (mean 10.4 [SD 9.7] vs 21.0 [20.7], p=0.022). The
      rehabilitation group had more primary-care consultations at the
      general-practitioner's premises than did the control group (8.6 [6.8] vs 7.3
      [8.3], p=0.033) but fewer primary-care home visits (1.5 [2.8] vs 2.8 [4.6],
      p=0.037). Compared with control, the rehabilitation group also showed greater
      improvements in walking ability and in general and disease-specific health
      status. INTERPRETATION: For patients chronically disabled by obstructive
      pulmonary disease, an intensive, multidisciplinary, outpatient programme of
      rehabilitation is an effective intervention, in the short term and the long term,
      that decreases use of health services.

TI  - Oral administration of cefixime to lower risk febrile neutropenic children with
      cancer.
PG  - 2848-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia is a heterogeneous condition. Recently, several
      risk factors have been defined, permitting the definition of a lower risk group
      of patients who may benefit form less aggressive therapy. The use of an oral
      antibiotic approach was tested in the current trial. METHODS: From May 1997 to
      March 1998, 154 episodes of lower risk febrile neutropenia in 128 children with a
      mean age of 62 (range, 8-200) months were enrolled in this randomized,
      single-institution trial. Inclusion criteria were fever (> 38 degrees C),
      neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm(3)), lower risk features (i.e.,
      absence of severe comorbidity factors, good clinical condition, negative blood
      cultures, control of local infection, no fever during the last 24 hours), and
      compliance of parents. After 3 days of ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/day administered
      intravenously [i.v.]) every 12 hours plus amikacin (15 mg/kg/day i.v.) every 24
      hours for 3 days, all patients were discharged and randomized to be allocated to 
      2 treatment arms. Group A (n = 74) received ceftriaxone cefixime (8 mg/kg/day
      administered orally) every 24 hours for 4 days, whereas Group B (n = 80) was
      treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin for 7 days. Failure was defined as the
      need for second hospitalization during the same episode of neutropenia, or fever 
      during the 7 days after discharge. RESULTS: Most of the patients (49% in Group A 
      and 55% in Group B) had acute leukemia. Fifty-four (72%) children in Group A and 
      46 (56%) in Group B had fever of unknown origin (P = not significant [NS]). No
      significant differences were found in the sites of initial infection between the 
      two groups. Overall results were outstanding, with a favorable outcome in 73 of
      78 cases (98.6%) in Group A and 78 of 80 cases (97.5%) in Group B (P = NS). Three
      patients needed a second hospitalization due to failure of the initial therapy:
      one in Group A and two in Group B. All three did well with secondary treatment.
      CONCLUSIONS: In lower risk febrile neutropenic children receiving anticancer
      therapy, the efficacy of oral cefixime, given for 4 days after 72 hours of
      intravenous ceftriaxone plus amikacin, was similar to that of 7 days of
      parenteral ceftriaxone plus amikacin. The oral outpatient therapy approach to the
      treatment of lower risk febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy is safe and may be
      cost-saving. This strategy might be adopted as standard therapy in the future.

      versus self administered phosphate enema in bowel preparation for flexible
      sigmoidoscopy screening.
PG  - 1504-8; discussion 1509
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the acceptability and efficacy of two methods of self
      administered bowel preparation for flexible sigmoidoscopy screening: a single
      phosphate enema and a single sachet of Picolax. DESIGN: Single blind, randomised 
      trial. SETTING: Endoscopy units of two general hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 1442 men 
      and women aged 55-64 years who had agreed to be screened by flexible
      sigmoidoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MESURESs: Attendance rates, compliance with allocated
      preparations, adverse effects, quality of bowel preparation, procedure time, and 
      yield of neoplasia. RESULTS: Compliance with the enema was higher than with the
      Picolax (608 (84%) v 566 (79%); difference 6%, 95% confidence interval 2% to
      10%). Almost half of those who refused Picolax used an enema at home. Wind,
      incontinence, and sleep disturbance were more frequent in the Picolax group than 
      the enema group; bottom soreness was more frequent in the enema group. Around 30%
      (187) found the diet restriction required by Picolax difficult; 78% (471) found
      the enema easy to administer. The quality of preparation was better with the
      enema; the proportion of procedures complete to the descending colon was greater 
      and the mean duration of the procedure was shorter. There was no significant
      difference in polyp detection rates. CONCLUSION: A single phosphate enema self
      administered around one hour before leaving home is a more acceptable and
      effective method of preparing the distal bowel for flexible sigmoidoscopy than
      Picolax.

TI  - A specialized home care intervention improves survival among older post-surgical 
      cancer patients.
PG  - 1707-13
AB  - CONTEXT: Changes in the healthcare system have resulted in shortened hospital
      stays, moving the focus of care from the hospital to the home. Patients are
      discharged post-operatively with ongoing needs, and whether they receive nursing 
      care post-hospitalization can influence their recovery and survival. Little
      information is available about the factors that influence outcomes, including the
      survival of older cancer patients after cancer surgery. OBJECTIVE: To compare the
      length of survival of older post-surgical cancer patients who received a
      specialized home care intervention provided by advanced practice nurses (APNs)
      with that of patients who received usual follow-up care in an ambulatory setting.
      We also assessed potential predictors of survival in terms of depressive
      symptoms, symptom distress, functional status, comorbidities, length of hospital 
      stay, age of patient, and stage of disease. DESIGN: A randomized controlled
      intervention study. SETTING: Discharged older cancer patients after surgery at a 
      Comprehensive Cancer Center in southeastern Pennsylvania. PATIENTS: Three hundred
      seventy-five patients aged 60 to 92, newly diagnosed with solid cancers, were
      treated surgically between February 1993 and December 1995. One hundred ninety
      patients were randomized to the intervention groups and 185 to the usual care
      group. INTERVENTION: The intervention was a standardized protocol that consisted 
      of standard assessment and management post-surgical guidelines, doses of
      instructional content, and schedules of contacts. The intervention lasted 4 weeks
      and consisted of three home visits and five telephone contacts provided by APNs. 
      Both the patients and their family caregivers received comprehensive clinical
      assessments, monitoring, and teaching, including skills training. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE: Time from enrollment of patients into the study until death or last date
      known alive at the end of November 1996. RESULTS: During the 44-month follow-up
      period, 93 (24.8%) of 375 patients died. Forty-one (22%) of those who died were
      patients in the specialized home care intervention group, compared with 52 (28%) 
      in the usual care group. Stage of disease at diagnosis differed between the two
      groups at baseline (38% late stage patients in the intervention group compared
      with 26% in the control group, P = .01), so stratified analysis was performed.
      Overall, the specialized home care intervention group was found to have increased
      survival (P = .002 using stratified log-rank test). Among early stage patients
      only, there was no difference in survival between the intervention and control
      groups. Among late stage patients, there was improved survival in the
      intervention group. For example, 2-year survival among late stage intervention
      group cases was 67% compared with 40% among control cases. When Cox's
      proportional hazard model was used to adjust for significant baseline covariates,
      the relative hazard of death in the usual care group was 2.04 (CI: 1.33 to 3.12; 
      P = .001) after adjusting for stage of disease and surgical hospitalization
      length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first empirical study of post-surgical
      cancer patients to link a specialized home care intervention by advanced practice
      nurses with improved survival. Additional research is needed to test home care
      interventions aimed at maintaining quality of life outcomes and their effects on 
      survival of post-surgical cancer patients.

      BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction in patients with CHF can be corrected by both
      dietary supplementation with L-arg. and regular physical exercise. METHODS: Forty
      patients with severe CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction 19 +/- 9%) were
      randomized to an L-arg. group (8 g/day), a training group (T) with daily handgrip
      training, L-arg. and T (L-arg. + T) or an inactive control group (C). The mean
      internal radial artery diameter was determined at the beginning and after four
      weeks in response to brachial arterial administration of acetylcholine (ACh)
      (7.5, 15, 30 microg/min) and nitroglycerin (0.2 mg/min) with a transcutaneous
      high-resolution 10 MHz A-mode echo tracking system coupled with a Doppler device.
      The power of the study to detect clinically significant differences in
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation was 96.6%. RESULTS: At the beginning, the mean
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation in response to ACh, 30 microg/min was 2.54 +/-
      0.09% (p = NS between groups). After four weeks, internal radial artery diameter 
      increased by 8.8 +/- 0.9% after ACh 30 microg/min in L-arg. (p < 0.001 vs. C), by
      8.6 +/- 0.9% in T (p < 0.001 vs. C) and by 12.0 +/- 0.3% in L-arg. +/- T (p <
      0.005 vs. C, L-arg. and T). Endothelium-independent vasodilation as assessed by
      infusion of nitroglycerin was similar in all groups at the beginning and at the
      end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplementation of L-arg. as well as
      regular physical exercise improved agonist-mediated, endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation to a similar extent. Both interventions together seem to produce
      additive effects with respect to endothelium-dependent vasodilation.

TI  - Recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against CD18 (rhuMAb CD18) in traumatic
      hemorrhagic shock: results of a phase II clinical trial. Traumatic Shock Group.
PG  - 611-9; discussion 619-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activated neutrophils have been shown to play a pivotal role in
      resuscitation injury after traumatic hemorrhagic shock. Blocking the adhesion of 
      neutrophils with a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against CD18 (rhuMAb
      CD18) may reduce resuscitation injury but increase the risk of infection. This
      was a dose-finding phase II study to determine safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and clinical outcome parameters for additional studies.
      METHODS: This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized (3:1),
      double-blind phase II trial enrolling 116 blunt and penetrating trauma patients
      from 14 trauma centers over a 9-month period. Patients with hypotension (blood
      pressure < or =90 mm Hg) from hemorrhagic shock were given a single intravenous
      dose of rhuMAb CD18 or placebo. The three doses tested were 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg. 
      The drug was administered within 4 hours of the hypotensive episode and no later 
      than 6 hours from time of injury. Exclusion criteria included head injury
      resulting in Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 8 or a history of cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation in the trauma center. An independent Drug Safety and Monitoring
      Review Board periodically reviewed unblinded data for safety issues and to give
      approval for dose escalation. RESULTS: Minor and major infection rates in rhuMAb 
      CD18 groups were comparable to placebo. There was no evidence of antibody
      formation against rhuMAb CD18. Linear PK was observed within the dose range
      studied. Duration of neutrophil binding was dose-dependent, with 2 mg/kg
      resulting in greater than 90% neutrophil CD18 receptor saturation for
      approximately 48 hours. The mortality was 6.7% (2 of 30) in the placebo group,
      4.8% (1 of 21) in the 0.5-mg/kg group, 8.5% (4 of 47) in the 1-mg/kg group, and
      0% (0 of 18) in the 2-mg/kg group. The study was not powered for efficacy, and
      none of the efficacy variables demonstrated statistical significance. Favorable
      trends were seen in the 2-mg/kg group as compared with placebo in median
      intensive care unit length of stay (5 vs. 9 days) and median time on ventilator
      (34 vs. 72 hours). CONCLUSIONS: A single 2-mg/kg dose of rhuMAb CD18 maintains
      greater than 90% saturation of neutrophil CD18 receptors for approximately 48
      hours in patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock undergoing resuscitation.
      There was no trend toward increased infection. A larger trial is needed to
      demonstrate the clinical efficacy of rhuMAb CD18, perhaps using more reliable
      endpoints.

TI  - Management of patients with acute coronary syndromes in the United States by
      platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. Insights from the platelet
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in unstable angina: receptor suppression using integrilin
      therapy (PURSUIT) trial.
PG  - 1093-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Platelet
      Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin
      Therapy, PURSUIT) demonstrated that the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor
      antagonist eptifibatide reduced the incidence of death or myocardial infarction
      among patients with acute ischemic syndromes without ST-segment elevation.
      Because of expected differences in practice patterns, a prospectively planned
      analysis of outcomes as a function of regions of the world was performed. The
      current study provides a detailed assessment of eptifibatide among the subgroup
      of patients enrolled within the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients
      presenting with chest pain within the previous 24 hours and ischemic ECG changes 
      or creatine kinase-MB elevation were eligible for enrollment. Of the 10 948
      patients randomized worldwide, 4035 were enrolled within the United States.
      Patients were allocated to placebo or eptifibatide infusion for up to 72 to 96
      hours. Other medical therapies and revascularization strategies were at the
      discretion of the treating physician. Eptifibatide reduced the rate of the
      primary end point of death or myocardial infarction by 30 days from 15.4% to
      11.9% (P=0.003) among patients in the United States. The treatment effect was
      achieved early and maintained over a period of 6 months (18.9% versus 15.2%;
      P=0.004). Bleeding events were more common in patients receiving eptifibatide but
      were predominantly associated with invasive procedures. The magnitude of clinical
      benefit from eptifibatide was greater among patients in the United States than
      elsewhere in the world. CONCLUSIONS: Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor
      blockade with eptifibatide reduces the incidence of death or myocardial
      infarction among patients treated for acute ischemic syndromes without ST-segment
      elevation within the United States.

TI  - Ciprofibrate therapy improves endothelial function and reduces postprandial
      lipemia and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1773-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exaggerated postprandial lipemia (PPL) is a factor in atherogenesis, 
      involving endothelial dysfunction and enhanced oxidative stress. We examined the 
      effect of ciprofibrate therapy on these parameters in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty patients entered a 3-month, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study. Each subject was studied fasting and after a fatty
      meal, at baseline, and after 3 months of treatment. Glucose and lipid profiles
      were measured over an 8-hour postprandial period. Endothelial function
      (flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation [FMD]) and oxidative stress
      (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) were measured after fasting and 4 
      hours postprandially. At baseline, both groups exhibited similar PPL and
      deterioration in endothelial function. After ciprofibrate, fasting and
      postprandial FMD values were significantly higher (from 3.8+/-1. 8% and
      1.8+/-1.3% to 4.8+/-1.1% and 3.4+/-1.1%; P<0.05). This was mirrored by a fall in 
      fasting and postprandial triglycerides (3. 1+/-2.1 and 6.6+/-4.1 mmol/L to
      1.5+/-0.8 and 2.8+/-1.3 mmol/L, P<0. 05). Fasting and postprandial HDL
      cholesterol was also elevated (0. 9+/-0.1 and 0.8+/-0.1 mmol/L and 1.2+/-0.2 and 
      1.2+/-0.1 mmol/L, P<0. 05). There were no changes in total or LDL cholesterol.
      Fasting and postprandial triglyceride enrichment of all lipoproteins was
      attenuated, with cholesterol depletion of VLDL and enrichment of HDL. There were 
      similar postprandial increases in oxidative stress in both groups at baseline,
      which was significantly attenuated by ciprofibrate (0.3+/-0.6 versus 1.5+/-1.1 U,
      P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that fibrate therapy improves
      fasting and postprandial endothelial function in type 2 diabetes. Attenuation of 
      PPL and the associated oxidative stress, with increased HDL cholesterol levels,
      may be important.

TI  - Randomized, double-blind trial of simultaneous right and left atrial epicardial
      pacing for prevention of post-open heart surgery atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 761-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess simultaneous right and left
      atrial pacing as prophylaxis for postoperative atrial fibrillation. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: In a double-blind, randomized fashion, 118 patients who underwent open
      heart surgery were assigned to right atrial pacing at 45 bpm (RA-AAI; n=39),
      right atrial triggered pacing at a rate of >/=85 bpm (RA-AAT; n=38), or
      simultaneous right and left atrial triggered pacing at a rate of >/=85 bpm
      (Bi-AAT; n=41). Holter monitoring was performed for 4. 8+/-1.4 days after surgery
      to assess for episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting >5 minutes. The prevalence 
      of postoperative atrial fibrillation was significantly less in the patients
      randomized to biatrial AAT pacing when compared with the other 2 pacing regimens 
      (P=0.02). An episode of atrial fibrillation occurred in 4 (10%) of 41 patients in
      the Bi-AAT group compared with 11 (28%) of 39 patients in the RA-AAI group
      (P=0.03 versus Bi-AAT) and 12 (32%) of 38 patients in the RA-AAT group (P=0.01
      versus Bi-AAT). There was no difference in the occurrence of atrial fibrillation 
      between the right atrial AAI and AAT groups (P=0.8). There was no significant
      difference among the 3 groups with regard to the number of postoperative hospital
      days (7.3+/-4.2 days), morbidity (5.1%), or mortality rate (2.5%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Simultaneous right and left atrial triggered pacing is well tolerated and
      significantly reduces the prevalence of post-open heart surgery atrial
      fibrillation.

TI  - Coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients and their family member caregivers:
      outcomes of a family-focused staged psychoeducational intervention.
PG  - 142-50
AB  - This experimental study examined the effectiveness of a psychoeducational
      intervention delivered over 12 weeks. The sample was comprised of 38 coronary
      artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patient-family member caregiver dyads who
      completed all six data collection points. Experimental and control groups did not
      differ in emotional health, functional health status, or satisfaction.
      Differences in the number of self-reported complications/symptoms were not in the
      predicted direction. Improvement occurred in clinical, functional, and emotional 
      outcomes; however, several symptoms, such as fatigue and pain, persisted. Family 
      caregivers reported more depressive symptoms than patients preoperatively and at 
      later stages of recovery. Implications include the need for instruction about the
      recovery trajectory and adequate preparation and support of home health nurses
      and family caregivers.

      infarction in high-risk ischemic situations. Main results of the GUARDIAN trial. 
      Guard during ischemia against necrosis (GUARDIAN) Investigators.
PG  - 3032-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The transmembrane sodium/hydrogen exchanger maintains myocardial cell
      pH integrity during myocardial ischemia but paradoxically may precipitate cell
      necrosis. The development of cariporide, a potent and specific inhibitor of the
      exchanger, prompted this investigation of the potential of the drug to prevent
      myocardial cell necrosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 11 590 patients with
      unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) or undergoing
      high-risk percutaneous or surgical revascularization were randomized to receive
      placebo or 1 of 3 doses of cariporide for the period of risk. The trial failed to
      document benefit of cariporide over placebo on the primary end point of death or 
      MI assessed after 36 days. Doses of 20 and 80 mg every 8 hours had no effect,
      whereas a dose of 120 mg was associated with a 10% risk reduction (98% CI 5.5% to
      23.4%, P=0.12). With this dose, benefit was limited to patients undergoing bypass
      surgery (risk reduction 25%, 95% CI 3.1% to 41.5%, P=0.03) and was maintained
      after 6 months. No effect was seen on mortality. The rate of Q-wave MI was
      reduced by 32% across all entry diagnostic groups (2.6% versus 1.8%, P=0.03), but
      the rate of non-Q-wave MI was reduced only in patients undergoing surgery (7.1%
      versus 3.8%, P=0.005). There were no increases in clinically serious adverse
      events. CONCLUSIONS: No significant benefit of cariporide could be demonstrated
      across a wide range of clinical situations of risk. The trial documented safety
      of the drug and suggested that a high degree of inhibition of the exchanger could
      prevent cell necrosis in settings of ischemia-reperfusion.

TI  - Concurrent chemotherapy and pelvic radiation therapy compared with pelvic
      radiation therapy alone as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery in high-risk
      early-stage cancer of the cervix.
PG  - 1606-13
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT)
      to pelvic radiation therapy (RT) will improve the survival of early-stage,
      high-risk patients with cervical carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with
      clinical stage IA(2), IB, and IIA carcinoma of the cervix, initially treated with
      radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, and who had positive pelvic
      lymph nodes and/or positive margins and/or microscopic involvement of the
      parametrium were eligible for this study. Patients were randomized to receive RT 
      or RT + CT. Patients in each group received 49.3 GY RT in 29 fractions to a
      standard pelvic field. Chemotherapy consisted of bolus cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) and a
      96-hour infusion of fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/d every 3 weeks for four cycles,
      with the first and second cycles given concurrent to RT. RESULTS: Between 1991
      and 1996, 268 patients were entered onto the study. Two hundred forty-three
      patients were assessable (127 RT + CT patients and 116 RT patients).
      Progression-free and overall survival are significantly improved in the patients 
      receiving CT. The hazard ratios for progression-free survival and overall
      survival in the RT only arm versus the RT + CT arm are 2.01 (P =.003) and 1.96 (P
      =. 007), respectively. The projected progression-free survivals at 4 years is 63%
      with RT and 80% with RT + CT. The projected overall survival rate at 4 years is
      71% with RT and 81% with RT + CT. Grades 3 and 4 hematologic and gastrointestinal
      toxicity were more frequent in the RT + CT group. CONCLUSION: The addition of
      concurrent cisplatin-based CT to RT significantly improves progression-free and
      overall survival for high-risk, early-stage patients who undergo radical
      hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for carcinoma of the cervix.

TI  - Pilot study of a home-based asthma health education program.
PG  - 93-102
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Caring for a child with asthma can affect the parent's coping and
      well-being and coping strategies. This study examined the influence of a
      home-based asthma health education program on parental coping and quality of
      life. DESIGN: Randomized controlled non-blinded clinical trial. SETTING: Northern
      community pediatrician's office. PATIENTS: Families whose children, under the age
      of 11, had chronic stable asthma, and who presented to the pediatrician's office 
      for continuing care; those with an acute exacerbation of asthma were excluded.
      INTERVENTIONS: Families were randomly assigned to receive either a single
      two-hour, standardized home-based asthma health education session or a booklet
      representing conventional care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One and three-months
      following the intervention, assessments were obtained for coping measured by
      Hymovich's Parent Perception Inventory (PPI), quality of life measured by the
      Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) and change in
      asthma measured by the Caregiver Perception of Change (CPC) survey. RESULTS:
      Forty families were recruited and randomized; baseline characteristics were
      similar between groups. At the final follow-up, reduction in parental need for
      asthma information (p = 0.04), reduction in parental concerns (p = 0.02) and
      increased use of coping strategies (p = 0.04) were observed in the home-based
      care group. Improvement was noted in the parent's perception of their child's
      asthma in the home-based asthma education group (p = 0.01). Quality of life as
      measured by the PACQLQ remained unchanged over the intervention period (p >
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the use of a one-time, flexible,
      home-based intervention to assist families caring for children with asthma should
      be considered and appears effective.

TI  - Oral misoprostol and intracervical dinoprostone for cervical ripening and labor
      induction: a randomized comparison.
PG  - 465-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy, safety, and tolerance of oral misoprostol with
      intracervical dinoprostone for cervical ripening and labor induction. METHODS:
      Two hundred women were randomized to receive single doses of oral misoprostol 200
      microg or 0.5 mg of dinoprostone intracervically every 6 hours for a maximum four
      doses. RESULTS: The intervals from administration of the drug to active phase of 
      labor (11.1 hours [7-24] versus 15.8 hours [7.5-29.62], P =. 01), to delivery
      (14.0 hours [8.42-27.61] versus 20.2 hours [16.7-32. 8], P =.01), and to rupture 
      of membranes (10.0 hours [4.95-24.7] versus 15.6 hours [8.2-29.2], P =.003) were 
      significantly shorter in the misoprostol group. All those variables were not
      distributed normally, so results are presented as median and interquartile range.
      The rates of women who needed oxytocin (68% versus 52%, P =.03) and cesarean for 
      failed induction (9% versus 1%, P =.01) were higher in the dinoprostone group.
      CONCLUSION: A single dose of 200 microg oral misoprostol was more effective for
      cervical ripening and labor induction than 0.5 mg of dinoprostone intracervically
      every 6 hours, with a maximum of four doses.

TI  - Use of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor to increase
      chemotherapy dose-intensity: a randomized trial in very high-risk childhood acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 1517-24
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the use of a recombinant human granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor ([G-CSF] lenogastrim) can increase the chemotherapy
      dose-intensity (CDI) delivered during consolidation chemotherapy of childhood
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven children
      with very high-risk ALL were randomized (slow early response to therapy, 55
      patients; translocation t(9;22) or t(4;11), 12 patients). Consolidation consisted
      of six courses of chemotherapy; the first, third, and fifth courses were a
      combination of high-dose cytarabine, etoposide, and dexamethasone (R3), whereas
      the second, fourth, and sixth courses included vincristine, prednisone,
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (COPADM). G-CSF was given after
      each course, and the next scheduled course was started as soon as neutrophil
      count was > 1 x 10(9)/L and platelet count was > 100 x 10(9)/L. CDI was
      calculated using the interval from day 1 of the first course to hematologic
      recovery after the fifth course (100% CDI = 105-day interval). RESULTS: CDI was
      significantly increased in the G-CSF group compared with the non-G-CSF group
      (mean +/- 95% confidence interval, 105 +/- 5% v 91 +/- 4%; P <.001). This higher 
      intensity was a result of shorter post-R3 intervals in the G-CSF group, whereas
      the post-COPADM intervals were not statistically reduced. After the R3 courses,
      the number of days with fever and intravenous antibiotics and duration of
      hospitalization were significantly decreased by G-CSF, whereas reductions
      observed after COPADM were not statistically significant. Duration of
      granulocytopenia was reduced in the G-CSF group, but thrombocytopenia was
      prolonged, and the number of platelet transfusions was increased. Finally, the
      3-year probability of event-free survival was not different between the two
      groups. CONCLUSION: G-CSF can increase CDI in high-risk childhood ALL. Its
      effects depend on the chemotherapy regimen given before G-CSF administration. In 
      our study, a higher CDI did not improve disease control.

TI  - First-line therapy for adult patients with acute asthma receiving a multiple-dose
      protocol of ipratropium bromide plus albuterol in the emergency department.
PG  - 1862-8
AB  - We designed a larger, double-blind, randomized, prospective trial to test our
      hypothesis that patients with acute asthma given combination high dose therapy
      with ipratropium bromide (IB) and beta(2)-agonists will have greater improvement 
      in pulmonary function and fewer hospital admissions than those given
      beta(2)-agonists alone. One hundred eighty patients (mean age +/- SD, 34.3 +/-
      10.5 yr) who presented to an emergency department (ED) for treatment of an
      exacerbation of asthma (baseline FEV(1) < 50% of predicted) were assigned in a
      randomized, double-blind fashion to receive albuterol and placebo (n = 92) or
      albuterol and IB (n = 88). Both drugs were administered through a metered-dose
      inhaler and spacer at 10-min intervals for 3 h (24 puffs or 2,880 microg of
      albuterol and 504 microg of IB each hour). Primary outcome measures were
      improvement in pulmonary function (FEV(1) or peak expiratory flow [PEF]), and
      hospital admission rates. In both groups, pulmonary function improved
      significantly over baseline values (p < 0.01). Subjects who received IB had an
      overall 20.5% (95% CI: 2.6 to 38.4%) (p = 0.02) greater improvement in PEF and a 
      48.1% (95% CI: 19.8 to 76.4%) (p = 0.001) greater improvement in FEV(1) from the 
      control group. At the end of protocol (3 h), 39% (n = 36) of patients in the
      control group and 20% (n = 18) in the IB group were admitted (p = 0.01). The use 
      of high doses of IB reduced the risk of hospital admission 49% (relative risk =
      0.51, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.83). Five (95% CI: 3 to 17) patients would need to be
      treated with high doses of IB to prevent a single admission.
      Kaplan-Meier-estimated curves of the proportion of patients who reached the
      discharge threshold during the 3 h of treatment, showed a significant difference 
      in favor of the IB group (log-rank test = 0.005). A subgroup analysis showed that
      patients most likely to benefit from the addition of high doses of IB were those 
      with more severe obstruction (FEV(1) </= 30% of predicted) and long duration of
      symptoms before the ED presentation (>/= 24 h). On the contrary, previous use of 
      inhaled beta(2)-agonists did not modify the admission rate and the pulmonary
      function response to IB. In conclusion, our data support a substantial
      therapeutic benefit from the addition of IB to albuterol administered in high
      doses through MDI plus spacer, particularly in patients with FEV(1) less than
      30%, and with long duration of symptoms before the ED presentation (>/= 24 h).

TI  - Early discharge for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 902-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously reported the use of a hospital based respiratory
      nurse service (Acute Respiratory Assessment Service, ARAS) to support home
      treatment of patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD). A controlled trial was undertaken to compare early discharge with home
      treatment supported by respiratory nurses with conventional hospital management
      of patients admitted with exacerbations of COPD. METHODS: Patients with COPD
      admitted as emergencies were identified the next working day. They were eligible 
      for inclusion in the study if the differential diagnosis included an exacerbation
      of COPD, but were excluded if other medical conditions or acidotic respiratory
      failure required inpatient investigation or management. Of 360 patients reviewed,
      209 were being assessed for other active medical problems and were excluded, 33
      potential participants were already involved in research studies and so were
      ineligible, and 37 did not wish to participate in the study. Eighty one patients 
      were randomised to receive conventional inpatient care (n=40) or to planned early
      discharge the next working day (n=41). Those discharged early continued treatment
      at home under the supervision of specialist respiratory nurses. Outcome measures 
      were readmission, additional hospital days, and deaths within 60 days of initial 
      admission. Process measures included number of visits, duration of follow up by
      the respiratory nurse, and additional treatment provided to support early
      discharge. RESULTS: On an intention to treat basis, a policy of early discharge
      reduced inpatient stay from a mean of 6.1 (range 1-13) days with conventional
      management to 3.2 (1-16) days with an early discharge policy. Twelve patients
      (30% conventional management, 29.3% early discharge) were readmitted in each
      group giving a mean difference in readmission of 0.7% (95% CI of the difference
      -19.2 to 20.6). In the conventional management group readmitted patients spent a 
      mean of 8.75 additional days in hospital compared with 7.83 days in the early
      discharge group, giving a mean difference of 0.92 days (95% CI of the difference 
      -6.5 to 8.3). There were two deaths (5%) in the conventional management group and
      one (2.4%) in the early discharge group, a mean difference of 2.6% (95% CI of the
      difference -5.7 to 10.8). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute exacerbations of COPD 
      uncomplicated by acidotic respiratory failure or other medical problems can be
      discharged home earlier than is current practice with support by visiting
      respiratory nurses. No difference was found in the subsequent need for
      readmission.

TI  - Abciximab improves both epicardial flow and myocardial reperfusion in
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Observations from the TIMI 14 trial.
PG  - 239-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the presence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, patients with 
      successful epicardial reperfusion (TIMI 3 flow) but persistent ST elevation on a 
      12-lead ECG are at high risk for subsequent death and left ventricular
      dysfunction. In the TIMI 14 trial, a dose-ranging angiographic study, combined
      therapy with abciximab plus reduced-dose tPA enhanced the speed and efficacy of
      epicardial reperfusion. We determined whether the combination of abciximab plus
      reduced-dose tPA provided additional benefit in terms of myocardial reperfusion, 
      as evidenced by greater resolution of ST elevation. METHODS AND RESULTS: All 346 
      patients with interpretable baseline and 90-minute ECGs, treated with either tPA 
      alone or abciximab plus reduced-dose tPA (combination therapy), were included.
      Patients receiving combination therapy (n=221) had a 59% rate of complete
      (>/=70%) ST resolution at 90 minutes versus 37% in those treated with tPA alone
      (n=125) (P<0.0001). When the analysis was limited to patients with TIMI 3 flow,
      patients treated with combination therapy (n=151) remained significantly more
      likely to achieve complete ST resolution than those receiving tPA alone (n=80)
      (69% versus 44%; P=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with abciximab and
      reduced-dose tPA improves myocardial (microvascular) reperfusion, as reflected in
      greater ST-segment resolution, in addition to epicardial flow. This finding may
      translate into improved clinical outcomes by enhancing myocardial salvage.

TI  - Suppressing and attending to pain-related thoughts in chronic pain patients.
PG  - 1117-24
AB  - Attempted suppression of pain-related thoughts was investigated in consecutive
      referrals for pain management (N = 39). Participants monitored their pain-related
      thoughts for three 5-min periods. In period 1, all participants were instructed
      to think about anything. For period 2, participants were instructed to either
      suppress pain-related thoughts, attend to pain-related thoughts, or to continue
      to think about anything. In period 3, all participants were again instructed to
      think about anything. Participants instructed to attend to their pain reported
      more pain-related thoughts than suppressors and controls in both periods 2 and 3.
      Suppressors experienced reduced pain-related thoughts during period 2. There was 
      no immediate enhancement or delayed increase.

TI  - Reperfusion and metabolic recovery of brain tissue and clinical outcome after
      ischemic stroke and thrombolytic therapy.
PG  - 1545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear from recent clinical trials whether
      thrombolytic agents are capable of facilitating reperfusion and metabolic
      recovery over time or whether a beneficial effect is counteracted by an increase 
      in the risk of brain hemorrhage. We studied the effect of thrombolytic treatment 
      on metabolic recovery after reperfusion and clinical outcome. METHODS: Patients
      were prospectively studied with (99m)Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon
      emission computed tomography ((99m)Tc-ECD-SPECT) before treatment with
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA; 0.9 mg/kg IV; n=26) or placebo
      (n=26) 6 to 8 hours after treatment and at 7+/-1 days. Activity deficits were
      graded, compared between the treatment groups, and correlated with clinical
      outcome and the incidence of brain hemorrhage. Metabolic recovery of ischemic
      brain tissue was defined as a 25% decrease on the SPECT graded scale. RESULTS:
      Patients with metabolic recovery (n=28) had a better chance of being functionally
      unimpaired 3 months after stroke than patients without recovery (n=24) (OR 4.5,
      95% CI 1.09 to 18.89) and had smaller infarcts on follow-up CT (36+/-38 versus
      167+/-162 mL), regardless of whether metabolic recovery was observed within 6 to 
      8 hours of treatment or at 7 days. None of the 28 patients with metabolic
      recovery had a fatal parenchymal hemorrhage versus 5 of 24 patients without
      recovery (P=0.016). Treatment did not affect the incidence of brain tissue
      metabolic recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Brain tissue metabolic recovery after ischemic
      stroke was associated with a beneficial effect on clinical outcome and was not
      facilitated by treatment with 0.9 mg of intravenous rTPA.

TI  - Pentoxifylline improves short-term survival in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis: 
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1637-48
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: An earlier pilot study from our liver unit suggested benefit
      from treatment with pentoxifylline (PTX), an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF), in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to
      evaluate this treatment in a larger cohort of patients. METHODS: One hundred one 
      patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey discriminant factor > or = 32) 
      entered a 4-week double-blind randomized trial of PTX (400 mg orally 3 times
      daily) vs. placebo. Primary endpoints of the study were the effect of PTX on (1) 
      short-term survival and (2) progression to hepatorenal syndrome. On
      randomization, there were no differences in demographic and clinical
      characteristics or laboratory values (including TNF) between the 2 groups.
      RESULTS: Twelve (24.5%) of the 49 patients who received PTX and 24 (46.1%) of the
      52 patients who received placebo died during the index hospitalization (P =
      0.037; relative risk, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.97). Hepatorenal
      syndrome was the cause of death in 6 (50%) and 22 (91.7%) patients (P = 0.009;
      relative risk, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.65). Three variables (age,
      creatinine level on randomization, and treatment with PTX) were independently
      associated with survival. TNF values on randomization were not predictive of
      survival; however, during the study period they increased markedly in
      nonsurvivors compared with survivors in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with 
      PTX improves short-term survival in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. The
      benefit appears to be related to a significant decrease in the risk of developing
      hepatorenal syndrome. Increasing TNF levels during the hospital course are
      associated with an increase in mortality rate.

TI  - Enhanced efficacy of eptifibatide administration in patients with acute coronary 
      syndrome requiring in-hospital coronary artery bypass grafting. PURSUIT
      Investigators.
PG  - 2952-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with a recent episode of non-ST-segment elevation acute
      coronary syndrome before CABG have higher rates of operative morbidity and
      mortality than patients with stable coronary syndromes. The efficacy of
      administering eptifibatide to these patients undergoing in-hospital CABG is
      unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Platelet Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa in Unstable
      Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy (PURSUIT) trial randomized 
      10 948 patients to receive either eptifibatide or placebo. There were 1558 study 
      participants who underwent in-hospital CABG: 692 received placebo, and 866
      received eptifibatide. The main substudy analysis end point was death or
      myocardial infarction (MI) rates at the 6-month follow-up. The 30-day death or MI
      rates were 30. 8% and 26.1% for the placebo and eptifibatide groups, respectively
      (P:=0.041). The benefit of eptifibatide administration persisted through 6-months
      of follow-up (32.7% versus 27.6% for placebo versus eptifibatide, respectively;
      P:=0.029). There was a greater reduction in the 6-month death or MI rate for
      patients who received eptifibatide within 72 hours of CABG (33.6% versus 23.8%;
      P:=0.002) compared with the >72-hour group (31.6% versus 32%; P:=1.0). The
      incidence of major bleeding was 56.6% for placebo-treated patients versus 58.2%
      for eptifibatide-treated patients (P:=0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Eptifibatide
      administration in patients undergoing in-hospital CABG with a recent episode of a
      non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome results in a significant
      reduction in death or MI that is evident at 7 days and persists through the
      6-month follow-up without a significant increase in perioperative bleeding rates.

TI  - Amylase-resistant starch plus oral rehydration solution for cholera.
PG  - 308-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although standard glucose-based oral rehydration therapy corrects the
      dehydration caused by cholera, it does not reduce the diarrhea. Short-chain fatty
      acids, which are produced in the colon from nonabsorbed carbohydrates, enhance
      sodium absorption. We conducted a study to determine the effects of an orally
      administered, nonabsorbed starch (i.e., one resistant to digestion by amylase) on
      fecal fluid loss and the duration of diarrhea in patients with cholera. METHODS: 
      We randomly assigned 48 adolescents and adults with cholera to treatment with
      standard oral rehydration therapy (16 patients), standard therapy and 50 g of
      rice flour per liter of oral rehydration solution (16 patients), or standard
      therapy and 50 g of high-amylose maize starch, an amylase-resistant starch, per
      liter of oral rehydration solution (16 patients). The primary end points were
      fecal weight (for every 12-hour period during the first 48 hours after
      enrollment) and the length of time to the first formed stool. RESULTS: The mean
      (+/-SD) fecal weights in the periods 12 to 24 hours, 24 to 36 hours, and 36 to 48
      hours after enrollment were significantly lower in the resistant-starch group
      (2206+/-1158 g, 1810+/-1018 g, and 985+/-668 g) than in the standard-therapy
      group (3251+/-766 g, 2621+/-1149 g, and 2498+/-1080 g; P=0.01, P= 0.04, and
      P=0.001, respectively). From 36 to 48 hours after enrollment, fecal weight was
      also significantly lower with the resistant-starch therapy than with the
      rice-flour therapy (985+/-668 g vs. 1790+/-866 g, P=0.01). The mean duration of
      diarrhea was significantly shorter with the resistant-starch therapy (56.7+/-18.6
      hours) than with standard therapy alone (90.9+/-29.8 hours, P=0.001) or the
      rice-flour therapy (70.8+/-20.2 hours, P=0.05). Fecal excretion of starch was
      higher with the resistant-starch therapy (32.6+/-30.4) than with the standard
      therapy (11.7+/-4.1 g, P=0.002) or the rice-flour therapy (15.1+/-8.4 g, P=0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a resistant starch to oral rehydration solution
      reduces fecal fluid loss and shortens the duration of diarrhea in adolescents and
      adults with cholera.

TI  - Neonatal effects of nifedipine and ritodrine for preterm labor.
PG  - 477-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared nifedipine and ritodrine for treatment of preterm labor
      with respect to neonatal outcome. METHODS: We conducted an open randomized
      multicenter study of neonatal outcome in 185 women who received either oral
      nifedipine (n = 95) or intravenous (IV) ritodrine (n = 90) for treatment of
      preterm labor. Secondary outcome measures included neonatal mortality and
      morbidity, especially neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, respiratory 
      distress syndrome (RDS), and intracranial bleeding. RESULTS: There were no
      significant differences in umbilical artery pH values and Apgar scores between
      groups. Nifedipine was associated with lower admission rates to the NICU (49%
      versus 66%; odds ratio 0. 51, confidence interval 0.28, 0.93) compared with
      ritodrine, and lower incidences of RDS (21% versus 37%; 0.46, 0.24, 0.89),
      intracranial bleeding (18% versus 31%; 0.48, 0.24, 0.96), and neonatal jaundice
      (52% versus 67%; 0.53, 0.29, 0.97). Logistic regression analysis showed that even
      after correction for gestational age at birth, newborn risk of RDS, intracranial 
      bleeding, or neonatal jaundice was significantly lower in the nifedipine group
      than the ritodrine group. CONCLUSION: Nifedipine for treatment of preterm labor
      was associated with a lower incidence of neonatal morbidity than ritodrine. That 
      difference appeared to be partly because of the higher tocolytic efficacy of
      nifedipine and partly because of an intrinsic beneficial effect of nifedipine, or
      the lack of harmful effects when compared with ritodrine.

TI  - Quality improvement for depression enhances long-term treatment knowledge for
      primary care clinicians.
PG  - 868-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of implementing quality improvement (QI)
      programs for depression, relative to usual care, on primary care clinicians'
      knowledge about treatment. DESIGN AND METHODS: Matched primary care clinics (46) 
      from seven managed care organizations were randomized to usual care (mailed
      written guidelines only) versus one of two QI interventions. Self-report surveys 
      assessed clinicians' knowledge of depression treatments prior to full
      implementation (June 1996 to March 1997) and 18 months later. We used an
      intent-to-treat analysis to examine intervention effects on change in knowledge, 
      controlling for clinician and practice characteristics, and the nested design.
      PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighty-one primary care clinicians. INTERVENTIONS: The 
      interventions included institutional commitment to QI, training local experts,
      clinician education, and training nurses for patient assessment and education.
      One intervention had resources for nurse follow-up on medication use (QI-meds)
      and the other had reduced copayment for therapy from trained, local therapists
      (QI-therapy). RESULTS: Clinicians in the intervention group had greater increases
      compared with clinicians in the usual care group over 18 months in knowledge of
      psychotherapy (by 20% for QI-meds, P =.04 and by 33% for QI-therapy, P =.004),
      but there were no significant increases in medication knowledge. Significant
      increases in knowledge scores (P =.01) were demonstrated by QI-therapy clinicians
      but not clinicians in the QI-meds group. Clinicians were exposed to multiple
      intervention components. CONCLUSIONS: Dissemination of QI programs for depression
      in managed, primary care practices improved clinicians' treatment knowledge over 
      18 months, but breadth of learning was somewhat greater for a program that also
      included active collaboration with local therapists.

TI  - A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of risperidone addition in serotonin
      reuptake inhibitor-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 794-801
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, only 1 controlled study has found a drug (haloperidol) to be
      efficacious in augmenting response in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
      (OCD) refractory to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) monotherapy; patients with
      comorbid chronic tic disorders showed a preferential response. This report
      describes the first controlled study of risperidone addition in patients with OCD
      refractory to treatment with SRI alone. METHODS: Seventy adult patients with a
      primary DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD received 12 weeks of treatment with an SRI.
      Thirty-six patients were refractory to the SRI and were randomized in a
      double-blind manner to 6 weeks of risperidone (n = 20) or placebo (n = 16)
      addition. Behavioral ratings, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
      Scale, were obtained at baseline and throughout the trial. Placebo-treated
      patients subsequently received an identical open-label trial of risperidone
      addition. RESULTS: For study completers, 9 (50%) of 18 risperidone-treated
      patients were responders (mean daily dose, 2.2 +/-0.7 mg/d) compared with 0 of 15
      in the placebo addition group (P<. 005). Seven (50%) of 14 patients who received 
      open-label risperidone addition responded. Risperidone addition was superior to
      placebo in reducing OCD (P<.001), depressive (P<.001), and anxiety (P =.003)
      symptoms. There was no difference in response between OCD patients with and
      without comorbid diagnoses of chronic tic disorder or schizotypal personalty
      disorder. Other than mild, transient sedation, risperidone was well tolerated.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OCD patients with and without comorbid
      chronic tic disorders or schizotypal personality disorder may respond to the
      addition of low-dose risperidone to ongoing SRI therapy.

TI  - Behavioral treatment of childhood social phobia.
PG  - 1072-80
AB  - Sixty-seven children (ages 8 and 12) with social phobia were randomized to either
      a behavioral treatment program designed to enhance social skills and decrease
      social anxiety (Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children, SET-C) or an active,
      but nonspecific intervention (Testbusters). Children treated with SET-C were
      significantly more improved across multiple dimensions, including enhanced social
      skill, reduced social fear and anxiety, decreased associated psychopathology, and
      increased social interaction. Furthermore, 67% of the SET-C group participants
      did not meet diagnostic criteria for social phobia at posttreatment compared with
      5% of those in the Testbusters group. Treatment gains were maintained at 6-month 
      follow-up. The results are discussed in terms of treatment of preadolescent
      children with social phobia and the durability of treatment effects.

TI  - Negative mood changes during hormone replacement therapy: a comparison between
      two progestogens.
PG  - 1419-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare side effects of
      medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethindrone acetate during postmenopausal
      hormone replacement therapy in women with and without a history of premenstrual
      syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty-one postmenopausal women were randomly selected in 
      a double-blind crossover study. The women received 2 mg of estradiol continuously
      during five 28-day cycles and 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone or 1 mg of
      norethindrone sequentially for 12 days of each cycle. Daily symptom rating scales
      were kept. RESULTS: The women showed cyclic changes, with negative mood and
      physical symptoms culminating during the late progestogen phase and positive mood
      during the estrogen-only phase. Symptoms declined with time but remained after 5 
      months. Women with a history of premenstrual syndrome responded strongly to both 
      progestogens. Medroxyprogesterone acetate induced less negative and more positive
      mood symptoms than norethindrone in women with no history of premenstrual
      syndrome. In both groups medroxyprogesterone caused more physical symptoms than
      norethindrone. CONCLUSION: The addition of medroxyprogesterone to estrogen is
      preferable to norethindrone with respect to mood symptoms in women without a
      history of premenstrual syndrome.

      spectrum of disease severity: AIDS Clinical Trials Groups 209 and 214.
PG  - 1357-64
AB  - The potential role of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific immune
      responses in controlling viral replication in vivo has stimulated interest in
      enhancing virus-specific immunity by vaccinating infected individuals with HIV-1 
      or its components. These studies were undertaken to define patient populations
      most likely to respond to vaccination, with the induction of novel HIV-1-specific
      cellular immune responses, and to compare the safety and immunogenicity of
      several candidate recombinant HIV-1 envelope vaccines and adjuvants. New
      lymphoproliferative responses (LPRs) developed in <30% of vaccine recipients.
      LPRs were elicited primarily in study participants with a CD4 cell count >350
      cells/mm(3) and were usually strain restricted. Responders tended to be more
      likely than nonresponders to have an undetectable level of HIV-1 RNA at baseline 
      (P=.067). Induction of new cellular immune responses by HIV-1 envelope vaccines
      is a function of the immunologic stage of disease and baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA
      level and exhibits considerable vaccine strain specificity.

TI  - Adequate timing of fetal ultrasound to guide metabolic therapy in mild
      gestational diabetes mellitus. Results from a randomized study.
PG  - 649-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasound assessment of abdominal circumference early in the third
      trimester had been proposed to introduce insulin therapy in order to prevent
      fetal overgrowth in women with mild gestational diabetes mellitus. The purpose of
      this study was to investigate adequate weeks gestation timing for testing this
      parameter. METHODS: One hundred and forty-one women were included in a randomized
      trial. Seventy-three women were evaluated at both 28 and 32 weeks gestation
      whereas 68 women were investigated only at 32 weeks gestation. In both groups,
      insulin therapy was promptly started when abdominal circumference exceeded the
      75th percentile. Macrosomic rates were compared using the Fisher's exact test.
      RESULTS: Twenty-nine women whose fetal abdominal circumference exceeded the 75th 
      percentile were considered eligible for insulin therapy. In this group, we
      observed a statistically significant increase in the percentage of macrosomic
      infants born from women whose ultrasound abdominal circumference assessment was
      performed only at 32 weeks gestation when compared to women evaluated at both 28 
      and 32 weeks gestation (71.43% vs 33.33%, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      support the need for fetal ultrasound at 28 weeks gestation to direct metabolic
      therapy since insulin administration introduced after 32 weeks gestation has a
      poor effect on fetal growth.

TI  - 3-year suppression of HIV viremia with indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine.
PG  - 35-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral regimens containing HIV protease inhibitors suppress
      viremia in HIV-infected patients, but the durability of this effect is not known.
      OBJECTIVE: To describe the 3-year follow-up of patients randomly assigned to
      receive indinavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine in an ongoing clinical trial.
      DESIGN: Open-label extension of a randomized, double-blind study. SETTING: Four
      clinical research units. PATIENTS: 33 HIV-infected, zidovudine-experienced
      patients with serum HIV RNA levels of at least 20,000 copies/mL and CD4 counts
      ranging from 50 to 400 cells/mm3. INTERVENTION: Indinavir, zidovudine, and
      lamivudine. MEASUREMENTS: Safety assessments, HIV RNA levels, CD4 cell counts,
      and genotypic analyses. RESULTS: After 3 years of follow-up, 21 of 31
      contributing patients (68% [95% CI, 49% to 83%]) had serum viral load levels less
      than 500 copies/mL. Twenty of 31 (65% [CI, 45% to 80%]) had levels less than 50
      copies/mL. The median increase in CD4 count from baseline was 230 cells/mm3
      (interquartile range, 150 to 316 cells/mm3). Nephrolithiasis occurred in 12 of 33
      patients (36%). CONCLUSION: A three-drug regimen of indinavir, zidovudine, and
      lamivudine suppressed viremia in two thirds of patients for at least 3 years.

TI  - A multicenter controlled trial of fetal pulse oximetry in the intrapartum
      management of nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns.
PG  - 1049-58
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent developments permit the use of pulse oximetry to evaluate fetal
      oxygenation in labor. We tested the hypothesis that the addition of fetal pulse
      oximetry in the evaluation of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns in labor
      improves the accuracy of fetal assessment and allows safe reduction of cesarean
      deliveries performed because of nonreassuring fetal status. STUDY DESIGN: A
      randomized, controlled trial was conducted concurrently in 9 centers. The
      patients had term pregnancies and were in active labor when abnormal fetal heart 
      rate patterns developed. The patients were randomized to electronic fetal heart
      rate monitoring alone (control group) or to the combination of electronic fetal
      monitoring and continuous fetal pulse oximetry (study group). The primary outcome
      was a reduction in cesarean deliveries for nonreassuring fetal status as a
      measure of improved accuracy of assessment of fetal oxygenation. RESULTS: A total
      of 1010 patients were randomized, 502 to the control group and 508 to the study
      group. There was a reduction of >50% in the number of cesarean deliveries
      performed because of nonreassuring fetal status in the study group (study, 4. 5%;
      vs. control, 10.2%; P =.007). However, there was no net difference in overall
      cesarean delivery rates (study, n = 147 [29%]; vs. control, 130 [26%]; P = .49)
      because of an increase in cesarean deliveries performed because of dystocia in
      the study group. In a blinded partogram analysis 89% of the study patients and
      91% of the control patients who had a cesarean delivery because of dystocia met
      defined criteria for actual dystocia. There was no difference between the 2
      groups in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. In terms of the operative
      intervention for nonreassuring fetal status, there was an improvement in both the
      sensitivity and the specificity for the study group compared with the control
      group for the end points of metabolic acidosis and need for resuscitation.
      CONCLUSION: The study confirmed its primary hypothesis of a safe reduction in
      cesarean deliveries performed because of nonreassuring fetal status. However, the
      addition of fetal pulse oximetry did not result in an overall reduction in
      cesarean deliveries. The increase in cesarean deliveries because of dystocia in
      the study group did appear to result from a well-documented arrest of labor.
      Fetal pulse oximetry improved the obstetrician's ability to more appropriately
      intervene by cesarean or operative vaginal delivery for fetuses who were actually
      depressed and acidotic. The unexpected increase in operative delivery for
      dystocia in the study group is of concern and remains to be explained.

TI  - A prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing telmisartan 80 mg with
      valsartan 80 mg in patients with mild to moderate hypertension using ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 1123-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of
      telmisartan 80 mg with valsartan 80 mg throughout a 24 h dosing interval. DESIGN:
      A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point, parallel group study.
      Treatment efficacy was compared using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      (ABPM), cuff sphygmomanometry and calculated responder rates. Tolerability was
      assessed by physical examination, laboratory parameters, 12-lead
      electrocardiogram, blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, and evaluation of
      adverse events. SETTING: Thirty-five centres in the United States. PATIENTS: Four
      hundred and twenty-six patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension
      entered the study. Ninety-two per cent (n=393) completed the study.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent a four-week, single-blind, placebo run-in
      period before being randomly assigned to once-daily oral telmisartan 80 mg
      (n=214) or valsartan 80 mg (n=212) for an eight-week, open-label treatment
      period. RESULTS: Treatment with telmisartan was associated with a significantly
      greater mean reduction from baseline in the last 6 h ABPM mean for diastolic
      blood pressure compared with the valsartan-treated group (-7.5+/-0.6 mmHg versus 
      -5.2+/-0.6 mmHg, respectively, P<0.01). Secondary analyses showed significantly
      greater efficacy with telmisartan 80 mg than with valsartan 80 mg, including
      greater mean reductions from baseline of ABPM (systolic blood pressure and
      diastolic blood pressure) during the daytime (06:00 to 21:59) and morning (06:00 
      to11:59) hours, and larger decreases in trough cuff blood pressure (P<0.01). Both
      treatments showed placebo-like tolerability profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Telmisartan 80
      mg once daily was superior to valsartan 80 mg once daily in reducing diastolic
      blood pressure during the last 6 h of the 24 h dosing interval. These results may
      be due to telmisartan's longer plasma half-life or to a higher potency compared
      with valsartan, such that a higher dose of valsartan may produce effects similar 
      to those of 80 mg telmisartan. These data confirm the long duration of action of 
      telmisartan with consistent and sustained control of blood pressure over 24 h and
      during the last 6 h of the dosing interval. Both treatments were well tolerated; 
      the adverse event data confirmed the excellent tolerability profiles of
      telmisartan and valsartan that have been reported previously.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial of dual blockade of renin-angiotensin system in
      patients with hypertension, microalbuminuria, and non-insulin dependent diabetes:
      the candesartan and lisinopril microalbuminuria (CALM) study.
PG  - 1440-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the effects of candesartan or lisinopril, or
      both, on blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion in patients with
      microalbuminuria, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Prospective,
      randomised, parallel group, double blind study with four week placebo run in
      period and 12 weeks' monotherapy with candesartan or lisinopril followed by 12
      weeks' monotherapy or combination treatment. SETTING: Tertiary hospitals and
      primary care centres in four countries (37 centres). PARTICIPANTS: 199 patients
      aged 30-75 years. INTERVENTIONS: Candesartan 16 mg once daily, lisinopril 20 mg
      once daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure and urinary albumin:creatinine 
      ratio. RESULTS: At 12 weeks mean (95% confidence interval) reductions in
      diastolic blood pressure were 9.5 mm Hg (7.7 mm Hg to 11.2 mm Hg, P<0.001) and
      9.7 mm Hg (7.9 mm Hg to 11.5 mm Hg, P<0.001), respectively, and in urinary
      albumin:creatinine ratio were 30% (15% to 42%, P<0.001) and 46% (35% to 56%,
      P<0.001) for candesartan and lisinopril, respectively. At 24 weeks the mean
      reduction in diastolic blood pressure with combination treatment (16.3 mm Hg,
      13.6 mm Hg to 18.9 mm Hg, P<0. 001) was significantly greater than that with
      candesartan (10.4 mm Hg, 7.7 mm Hg to 13.1 mm Hg, P<0.001) or lisinopril (mean
      10.7 mm Hg, 8.0 mm Hg to 13.5 mm Hg, P<0.001). Furthermore, the reduction in
      urinary albumin:creatinine ratio with combination treatment (50%, 36% to 61%,
      P<0.001) was greater than with candesartan (24%, 0% to 43%, P=0.05) and
      lisinopril (39%, 20% to 54%, P<0.001). All treatments were generally well
      tolerated. CONCLUSION: Candesartan 16 mg once daily is as effective as lisinopril
      20 mg once daily in reducing blood pressure and microalbuminuria in hypertensive 
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Combination treatment is well tolerated and more
      effective in reducing blood pressure.

TI  - The effect of selenium supplementation on outcome in very low birth weight
      infants: a randomized controlled trial. The New Zealand Neonatal Study Group.
PG  - 473-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low selenium (SE) status has been documented in preterm infants and
      has been suggested to be a risk factor for chronic lung disease. METHODS: A total
      of 534 infants with birth weight <1500 g were enrolled in 8 New Zealand centers
      in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of SE supplementation from 
      week 1 of life until 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or discharge home. Supplemented 
      infants received 7 microg/kg/d of SE when fed parenterally and 5 microg/kg/d when
      fed orally. Plasma SE and glutathione peroxidase concentrations were measured in 
      mothers after delivery and in infants before randomization and at 28 days and 36 
      weeks' postmenstrual age. Primary outcome measures were oxygen dependency at 28
      days and total days oxygen dependency. RESULTS: No significant differences were
      seen between the groups with respect to primary or secondary outcome measures,
      with the exception that fewer supplemented infants had an episode of sepsis after
      the first week of life (P <.038). Mean plasma SE concentrations were 0.33
      micromol/L before randomization in both groups and at 28 days had risen in the
      supplemented group (0.56 micromol/L) but fallen in the control group (0.29
      micromol/L) (P <.0001). There was no association between outcome measures and SE 
      concentrations at 28 days or 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. However, lower maternal
      and infant prerandomization SE concentrations were associated with increased
      respiratory morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal SE supplementation in very low
      birth weight infants did not improve neonatal outcome. Further investigation of
      SE supplementation of mothers from the second half of pregnancy is warranted.

TI  - Helping mothers discuss sexuality and AIDS with adolescents.
PG  - 1383-94
AB  - The current study was designed to alter experimentally mothers' style when
      discussing sexuality and AIDS with their adolescent children. Mothers of 11- to
      15-year-olds (N = 50) were assigned to an intervention or control group,
      resulting in 20 dyads in each group. All dyads were assessed twice, on
      self-reported and observed communication, AIDS knowledge, and perceived
      vulnerability to AIDS. Intervention group mothers received two training sessions.
      Observational data revealed that intervention group mothers reduced their amount 
      of speaking, asked more open-ended questions, acted less judgmental, and
      discussed dating and sexuality more than did control group mothers. Intervention 
      group adolescents reported increased discussions of birth control and increased
      daily comfort talking to their mothers. There was some evidence that intervention
      group girls increased in AIDS knowledge. There was no change in AIDS-related
      beliefs.

TI  - Role of computed tomographic scanning of the thorax prior to bronchoscopy in the 
      investigation of suspected lung cancer.
PG  - 359-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is the usual initial investigation of
      choice in patients with suspected endobronchial carcinoma, but it is often
      non-diagnostic. Once a positive diagnosis has been made, many patients undergo
      staging by computed tomographic (CT) scanning to assess the extent of the disease
      and its suitability for radical treatment. To determine whether initial CT
      scanning before FOB is a cost effective way of reducing subsequent unnecessary or
      unhelpful invasive diagnostic procedures, a study was undertaken in 171 patients 
      with suspected endobronchial carcinoma. METHODS: A randomised two group study was
      performed with all patients undergoing an initial CT staging scan. In group A the
      CT scans were reviewed before FOB, allowing cancellation or a change to an
      alternative invasive procedure if considered appropriate. In group B all patients
      proceeded to FOB with the bronchoscopist blinded to the result of the CT scan
      until after the procedure. RESULTS: In group A six of 90 patients (7%) required
      no further investigations as the CT scan was either normal, consistent with
      benign disease, or consistent with widespread metastatic disease. Of the
      remainder, bronchoscopy was diagnostic in 50 of 68 (73%) in group A compared with
      44 of 81 (54%) in group B (p = 0.015). Overall, a positive diagnosis was made
      after a single invasive investigation in 64 of 84 patients (76%) in group A
      compared with only 45 of 81 patients (55%) in group B (p = 0.005). Only seven of 
      90 patients (8%) in group A required more than one invasive investigation
      compared with 15 of 81 patients (18.5%) in group B. In patients with malignancy, 
      bronchoscopy was more likely to be diagnostic in group A (50 of 56 patients
      (89%)) than in group B (44 of 62 (71%); p = 0. 012), and the diagnosis was more
      frequently made on the initial invasive investigation (group A, 63 of 70 (90%);
      group B, 44 of 62 (71%); p = 0.004). Because of the lower number of invasive
      procedures performed in group A than in group B, the cost of performing CT scans 
      before FOB in all patients in group A would have equated to a projected cost of
      performing CT scans in 60% of patients after FOB in group B. CONCLUSIONS:
      Performing initial CT thoracic scans before bronchoscopy in patients with
      suspected endobronchial malignancy is a cost effective way of improving
      diagnostic yield from invasive diagnostic procedures and occasionally may obviate
      the need for any further investigation.

TI  - A randomized study comparing two different schedules of administration of
      cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine in advanced nonsmall cell lung
      carcinoma.
PG  - 1714-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized trial was designed to investigate the feasibility,
      toxicity, and activity of two different schedules of gemcitabine plus cisplatin
      in previously untreated patients with advanced (International Union Against
      Cancer (UICC) Stage IIIB-IV) nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). METHODS: From 
      February 1997 to September 1998, 82 patients with advanced NSCLC were entered
      onto the study and were randomized to gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on Days 1, 8, and 
      15 plus cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) on Day 2 (arm A) or Day 15 (arm B) every 28 days.
      RESULTS: All the patients were assessable for toxicity (arm A/arm B: 151/177
      cycles; median, 4 of 5 cycles per patient), and the following Grade 3-4
      toxicities were reported (percentage of cycles in arm A vs. arm B): anemia, 7.9% 
      and 2.3% (P < 0.05); leukopenia, 6.0% and 6.7%; thrombocytopenia, 15.0% and 1.6% 
      (P < 0.01); no World Health Organization (WHO) Grade 3-4 nonhematologic
      toxicities were observed. These side effects led to gemcitabine dose reductions
      in 35.1% of courses in arm A and 22.0% of courses in arm B (P < 0.05) and to
      gemcitabine omissions in 28.5% of courses in arm A versus 7.3% of courses in arm 
      B (P < 0.01). Dose intensities (DIs) of gemcitabine were 607.5 mg/m(2)/week in
      arm A and 711.6 mg/m(2)/week in arm B (P < 0.01); DIs of cisplatin were 18. 1
      mg/m(2)/week in arm A and 18.8 mg/m(2)/week in arm B. The total delivered doses
      of gemcitabine were 9315.5 mg/m(2) in arm A and 12, 631.0 mg/m(2) in arm B (P <
      0.01); the total delivered doses of cisplatin were 277.1 mg/m(2) in arm A and
      333.0 mg/m(2) in arm B (P < 0.01). Response rates according to intention to treat
      were 40.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.5-55.3) in arm A and 45% (95% CI,
      29.5-60.5) in arm B. The overall median duration of response was 7.4 months; the 
      median time to disease progression was 6 months (95% CI, 3-9) in arm A and 9
      months (95% CI, 4-14) in arm B (P < 0.02); the median overall survival was 10
      months (95% CI, 7.0-12.5) in arm A and 17 months (95% CI, 13.0-21.6) in arm B (P 
      < 0.01); the 1-year survival rates were 34% and 63%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Our data show that arm B (cisplatin on Day 15) is less toxic than arm A
      (cisplatin on Day 2) and allows the administration of significantly higher total 
      doses and dose intensities of chemotherapy. No significant differences in
      response rates were observed between the two schedules; patients on arm B
      experienced a significantly more prolonged progression free and overall survival;
      however, the study was not powered to detect differences in these outcomes.

TI  - Effects of ramipril on cardiovascular and microvascular outcomes in people with
      diabetes mellitus: results of the HOPE study and MICRO-HOPE substudy. Heart
      Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study Investigators.
PG  - 253-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular and
      renal disease. We investigated whether the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitor ramipril can lower these risks in patients with diabetes. METHODS: 3577
      people with diabetes included in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study, 
      aged 55 years or older, who had a previous cardiovascular event or at least one
      other cardiovascular risk factor, no clinical proteinuria, heart failure, or low 
      ejection fraction, and who were not taking ACE inhibitors, were randomly assigned
      ramipril (10 mg/day) or placebo, and vitamin E or placebo, according to a
      two-by-two factorial design. The combined primary outcome was myocardial
      infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. Overt nephropathy was a main outcome
      in a substudy. FINDINGS: The study was stopped 6 months early (after 4.5 years)
      by the independent data safety and monitoring board because of a consistent
      benefit of ramipril compared with placebo. Ramipril lowered the risk of the
      combined primary outcome by 25% (95% CI 12-36, p=0.0004), myocardial infarction
      by 22% (6-36), stroke by 33% (10-50), cardiovascular death by 37% (21-51), total 
      mortality by 24% (8-37), revascularisation by 17% (2-30), and overt nephropathy
      by 24% (3-40, p=0.027). After adjustment for the changes in systolic (2.4 mm Hg) 
      and diastolic (1.0 mm Hg) blood pressures, ramipril still lowered the risk of the
      combined primary outcome by 25% (12-36, p=0.0004). INTERPRETATION: Ramipril was
      beneficial for cardiovascular events and overt nephropathy in people with
      diabetes. The cardiovascular benefit was greater than that attributable to the
      decrease in blood pressure. This treatment represents a vasculoprotective and
      renoprotective effect for people with diabetes.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of recombinant human nerve growth factor in patients with
      diabetic polyneuropathy: A randomized controlled trial. rhNGF Clinical
      Investigator Group.
PG  - 2215-21
AB  - CONTEXT: Nerve growth factor is a neurotrophic factor that promotes the survival 
      of small fiber sensory neurons and sympathetic neurons in the peripheral nervous 
      system. Recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) has demonstrated efficacy
      as treatment for peripheral neuropathy in experimental models and phase 2
      clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 12-month
      regimen of rhNGF in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy. DESIGN: Randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial conducted from July 1997 through
      May 1999. SETTING: Eighty-four outpatient centers throughout the United States.
      PATIENTS: A total of 1019 men and women aged 18 to 74 years with either type 1 or
      type 2 diabetes and a sensory polyneuropathy attributable to diabetes.
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either rhNGF, 0.1
      microg/kg (n = 504), or placebo (n = 515) by subcutaneous injection 3 times per
      week for 48 weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 48
      weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was a change in
      neuropathy between baseline and week 48, demonstrated by the Neuropathy
      Impairment Score for the Lower Limbs, compared between the 2 groups. Secondary
      outcome measures included quantitative sensory tests using the CASE IV System,
      the Neuropathy Symptom and Change questionnaire, the Patient Benefit
      Questionnaire (PBQ), and a global symptom assessment, as well as nerve conduction
      studies and occurrence of new plantar foot ulcers. Patients also were evaluated
      for presence of adverse events. RESULTS: Among patients who received rhNGF, 418
      (83%) completed the regimen compared with 461 (90%) who received placebo.
      Administration of rhNGF was safe, with few adverse events attributed to treatment
      apart from injection site pain/hyperalgesia and other pain syndromes. However,
      neither the primary end point (P =.25) nor most of the secondary end points
      demonstrated a significant benefit of rhNGF. Exceptions were the global symptom
      assessment (P =.03) and 2 of 32 comparisons within the PBQ, which showed a modest
      but significant benefit of rhNGF (P =.05 for severity of pain in the legs and P
      =.003 for 6-month symptoms in the feet and legs). CONCLUSION: Unlike previous
      phase 2 trials, this phase 3 clinical trial failed to demonstrate a significant
      beneficial effect of rhNGF on diabetic polyneuropathy. JAMA. 2000;284:2215-2221.

TI  - Improved outcomes in patients with acute allergic syndromes who are treated with 
      combined H1 and H2 antagonists.
PG  - 462-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Although the addition of H(2) blockers to H(1) antagonists has
      been promoted for use in anaphylaxis, there have been no large studies
      establishing the advantage of this approach in treating acute allergic syndromes.
      In this study we tested the hypothesis that combined H(1) and H(2) blockage
      results in improved outcomes in patients treated for acute allergic syndromes
      compared with treatment with H(1) blockade alone. METHODS: In a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 91 adult patients with acute allergic
      syndromes were treated with either 50 mg of diphenhydramine and saline solution
      (control group) or with 50 mg of diphenhydramine and 50 mg of ranitidine (active 
      group). These patients were treated with parenteral administration. Patients were
      recruited from an emergency department at an urban academic medical center. The
      primary endpoints were resolution of urticaria, angioedema, or erythema at 2
      hours after protocol treatment. Areas of cutaneous involvement, heart rates,
      blood pressures, respiratory findings, and symptom scores were also assessed at
      baseline, 1 hour, and 2 hours. RESULTS: There were significantly more patients
      without urticaria at 2 hours among the patients in the active group compared with
      those in the control group. Both groups had similar proportions of urticaria at
      baseline. Logistic regression models to predict resolution of urticaria, which
      accounted for baseline urticarial involvement, showed odds ratios in favor of the
      active group treatment. Similar findings were observed when the absence of both
      urticaria and angioedema was considered as the dependent variable. There was not 
      a significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to the absence of
      erythema or angioedema (irrespective of the presence of urticaria) at 2 hours.
      Blood pressure and symptoms did not show differences between the 2 groups over
      time. Lower heart rates were observed 1 hour after treatment in the active
      treatment group (mean reduction 10 beats/min) compared with those found in the
      placebo group (mean reduction 6 beats/min). CONCLUSION: These data show that
      adding H(2) blockers to H(1) antagonists results in additional improvement of
      certain cutaneous outcomes for patients presenting with acute allergic syndromes.
      These findings favor the recommendation for using combined H(1) and H(2)
      antihistamines in acute allergic syndromes.

TI  - Effect of inhaled nitric oxide on key mediators of the inflammatory response in
      patients with acute lung injury.
PG  - 1736-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inhaled nitric oxide is used to treat hypoxia associated with acute
      lung injury. Endogenous nitric oxide regulates inflammatory responses, but the
      effect of inhaled nitric oxide therapy is unknown. We hypothesized that inhaled
      nitric oxide may alter inflammatory responses and endogenous nitric oxide
      synthase activity. DESIGN: A randomized, prospective interventional study.
      SETTING: A university hospital's general intensive care unit. PATIENTS:
      Thirty-two patients with acute lung injury. INTERVENTIONS: Patients who responded
      to test doses of nitric oxide were randomized to ventilator therapy with and
      without inhaled nitric oxide. The inhaled concentration of nitric oxide was
      determined by dose titration at 0, 2, 10, and 40 ppm and the minimum
      concentration used, which resulted in an increase in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio of at
      least 25%. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were followed up for 30 days
      or until death, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at 0, 24, and 72
      hrs. Nitric oxide synthase activity was measured spectrophotometrically, and
      myeloperoxidase, elastase, interleukin-8, and leukotrienes were measured in BAL
      fluid by enzyme immunoassay. Total nitrite and lipid peroxides in serum were
      measured colorimetrically. Nitric oxide synthase activity decreased (p = .01) and
      total nitrite increased (p = .02) in patients receiving inhaled nitric oxide.
      Other markers of inflammation in BAL fluid did not change. Lipid peroxide
      concentrations also did not alter. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in activity of
      nitric oxide synthase in patients receiving nitric oxide is likely to be the
      result of feedback inhibition of the enzyme. This study shows that inhaled nitric
      oxide has no effect on several markers of the inflammatory response system and
      does not lead to increased oxidant stress.

TI  - The presence of security blankets or mothers (or both) affects distress during
      pediatric examinations.
PG  - 322-30
AB  - Because of parental interference, some pediatricians prefer examining children
      without parents nearby. Can inanimate, noninterfering attachment agents placate
      children during medical evaluations? Accompanied through random assignment by
      their mother, blanket, mother plus blanket, or no supportive agent, 64
      blanket-attached or blanket-nonattached 3-year-olds underwent 4 routine medical
      procedures. Behavioral and physiological measures showed that mothers and
      blankets (for children attached to them) equally mitigated distress compared with
      no supportive agents. However, simultaneously presenting 2 attachment agents did 
      not produce additive soothing effects. For comforting blanket-attached children
      during moderately upsetting medical procedures, blankets can function as
      appropriate maternal substitutes. Distress evidenced by children with no
      attachment agent demonstrates the undesirability of conducting medical
      examinations without supportive agents.

TI  - Dose-response evaluation of the interaction between sertraline and alprazolam in 
      vivo.
PG  - 150-8
AB  - In vitro data show the inhibition of alprazolam metabolism by sertraline via
      CYP3A4; therefore, using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design,
      the authors conducted this study to assess the potential for similar in vivo
      inhibition in humans. Ten healthy volunteers participated in two test sessions
      (placebo/alprazolam 1 mg orally) before the initiation of sertraline treatment.
      Blood samples were obtained over a 32-hour period and pharmacodynamic measures
      (sedation, psychomotor performance, memory function) were obtained over an 8-hour
      period. After a minimum of 2 weeks of daily sertraline self-administration (50,
      100, or 150 mg/day), test sessions were repeated. Alprazolam concentrations (N = 
      6, 4, and 6 at sertraline doses of 50, 100, and 150 mg/day, respectively) showed 
      no significant changes based on peak concentration (Cmax), time to maximum
      concentration (Tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2[beta]), and area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC(0-8)), with the exception of a reduced Cmax in the 
      50 mg/day group. Similarly, dynamic data showed no significant variations based
      on peak effect, Tmax, and AUC(0-infinity), with the exception of increased peak
      impairment in one measure of psychomotor performance. No differences were
      detected between placebo alone and placebo plus sertraline. These findings
      suggest that sertraline (50-150 mg/day) does not alter the single-dose kinetics
      or dynamics of alprazolam; therefore, the combination may be prescribed without
      an increased risk of alprazolam toxicity.

TI  - High-dose intravenous isosorbide-dinitrate is safer and better than Bi-PAP
      ventilation combined with conventional treatment for severe pulmonary edema.
PG  - 832-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of bilevel positive 
      airway ventilation (BiPAP) in the treatment of severe pulmonary edema compared to
      high dose nitrate therapy. BACKGROUND: Although noninvasive ventilation is
      increasingly used in the treatment of pulmonary edema, its efficacy has not been 
      compared prospectively with newer treatment modalities. METHODS: We enrolled 40
      consecutive patients with severe pulmonary edema (oxygen saturation <90% on room 
      air prior to treatment). All patients received oxygen at a rate of 10 liter/min, 
      intravenous (IV) furosemide 80 mg and IV morphine 3 mg. Thereafter patients were 
      randomly allocated to receive 1) repeated boluses of IV isosorbide-dinitrate
      (ISDN) 4 mg every 4 min (n = 20), and 2) BiPAP ventilation and standard dose
      nitrate therapy (n = 20). Treatment was administered until oxygen saturation
      increased above 96% or systolic blood pressure decreased to below 110 mm Hg or by
      more than 30%. Patients whose conditions deteriorated despite therapy were
      intubated and mechanically ventilated. All treatment was delivered by mobile
      intensive care units prior to hospital arrival. RESULTS: Patients treated by
      BiPAP had significantly more adverse events. Two BiPAP treated patients died
      versus zero in the high dose ISDN group. Sixteen BiPAP treated patients (80%)
      required intubation and mechanical ventilation compared to four (20%) in the high
      dose ISDN group (p = 0.0004). Myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in 11 (55%) and
      2 (10%) patients, respectively (p = 0.006). The combined primary end point
      (death, mechanical ventilation or MI) was observed in 17 (85%) versus 5 (25%)
      patients, respectively (p = 0.0003). After 1 h of treatment, oxygen saturation
      increased to 96 +/- 4% in the high dose ISDN group as compared to 89 +/- 7% in
      the BiPAP group (p = 0.017). Due to the significant deterioration observed in
      patients enrolled in the BiPAP arm, the study was prematurely terminated by the
      safety committee. CONCLUSIONS: High dose ISDN is safer and better than BiPAP
      ventilation combined with conventional therapy in patients with severe pulmonary 
      edema.

TI  - Use of metoprolol CR/XL to maintain sinus rhythm after conversion from persistent
      atrial fibrillation: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 139-46
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy
      of metoprolol CR/XL to reduce the risk of relapse after cardioversion of
      persistent atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. BACKGROUND: Indirect data from
      studies with d,l sotalol provide evidence that the beta-blocking effects of the
      compound are important in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial 
      fibrillation. METHODS: After successful conversion to sinus rhythm, 394 patients 
      with a history of persistent atrial fibrillation were randomly assigned to
      treatment with metoprolol CR/XL or placebo. The two treatment groups were similar
      with respect to all pretreatment characteristics. Patients were seen on an
      outpatient basis for recording of resting electrocardiogram (ECG) after one week,
      one, three and six months of follow-up or whenever they felt that they had a
      relapse into atrial fibrillation or experienced an adverse event. RESULTS: In the
      metoprolol CR/XL group, 96 patients (48.7%) had a relapse into atrial
      fibrillation compared with 118 patients (59.9%) in the placebo group (p = 0.005).
      Heart rate in patients after a relapse into atrial fibrillation was significantly
      lower in the metoprolol group (98 +/- 23 beats/min) than in the placebo group
      (107 +/- 27 beats/min). The rate of adverse events reported was similar in both
      groups when the difference in follow-up time was taken into account. CONCLUSIONS:
      The results of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients after
      cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation showed that metoprolol CR/XL was 
      effective in preventing relapse into atrial fibrillation or flutter.

TI  - Effects of physiologic pacing versus ventricular pacing on the risk of stroke and
      death due to cardiovascular causes. Canadian Trial of Physiologic Pacing
      Investigators.
PG  - 1385-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that physiologic pacing (dual-chamber or atrial)
      may be superior to single-chamber (ventricular) pacing because it is associated
      with lower risks of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and death. These benefits have
      not been evaluated in a large, randomized, controlled trial. METHODS: At 32
      Canadian centers, patients without chronic atrial fibrillation who were scheduled
      for a first implantation of a pacemaker to treat symptomatic bradycardia were
      eligible for enrollment. We randomly assigned patients to receive either a
      ventricular pacemaker or a physiologic pacemaker and followed them for an average
      of three years. The primary outcome was stroke or death due to cardiovascular
      causes. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, atrial fibrillation, and
      hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS: A total of 1474 patients were
      randomly assigned to receive a ventricular pacemaker and 1094 to receive a
      physiologic pacemaker. The annual rate of stroke or death due to cardiovascular
      causes was 5.5 percent with ventricular pacing, as compared with 4.9 percent with
      physiologic pacing (reduction in relative risk, 9.4 percent; 95 percent
      confidence interval, -10.5 to 25.7 percent [the negative value indicates an
      increase in risk]; P=0.33). The annual rate of atrial fibrillation was
      significantly lower among the patients in the physiologic-pacing group (5.3
      percent) than among those in the ventricular-pacing group (6.6 percent), for a
      reduction in relative risk of 18.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.3
      to 32.6 percent; P=0.05). The effect on the rate of atrial fibrillation was not
      apparent until two years after implantation. The observed annual rates of death
      from all causes and of hospitalization for heart failure were lower among the
      patients with a physiologic pacemaker than among those with a ventricular
      pacemaker, but not significantly so (annual rates of death, 6.6 percent with
      ventricular pacing and 6.3 percent with physiologic pacing; annual rates of
      hospitalization for heart failure, 3.5 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively).
      There were significantly more perioperative complications with physiologic pacing
      than with ventricular pacing (9.0 percent vs. 3.8 percent, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Physiologic pacing provides little benefit over ventricular pacing for the
      prevention of stroke or death due to cardiovascular causes.

TI  - Raloxifene and estrogen effects on quality of life in healthy postmenopausal
      women: a placebo-controlled randomized trial.
PG  - 359-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of raloxifene, estrogen, and placebo on quality 
      of life in healthy, asymptomatic, postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a
      multicenter, double-blind, 12-month study, 398 women were assigned randomly to
      one of four groups: raloxifene HCl, 60 (n = 97) or 150 mg/day (n = 100);
      conjugated equine estrogens, 0. 625 mg/day (n = 96); or placebo (n = 105). The
      Women's Health Questionnaire, a validated quality-of-life instrument for
      perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, was administered at baseline and 3-month
      intervals. RESULTS: Overall, quality of life from baseline to end point was
      preserved equally in all treatment groups. Six domains (depressed mood, somatic
      symptoms, memory/concentration, sexual behavior, sleep problems, and perceived
      attractiveness) were unchanged in all groups. Three domains (menstrual symptoms, 
      vasomotor symptoms, and anxiety/fears) were statistically significantly different
      among groups. Mean scores for menstrual symptoms significantly worsened and
      vasomotor symptoms significantly improved from baseline to end point in the
      estrogen group. Mean scores for vasomotor symptoms did not worsen at any point in
      the raloxifene 60 mg/day group. Mean anxiety/fears scores improved significantly 
      during raloxifene 60 mg/day administration throughout treatment (P <.05),
      irrespective of previous hormone replacement therapy, baseline estradiol (E2)
      levels, or years postmenopause. CONCLUSION: Most quality-of-life domains were not
      affected by treatment with estrogen or raloxifene. Estrogen provided relief from 
      vasomotor symptoms but caused menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene 60 mg/day improved
      anxiety levels in postmenopausal women.

TI  - Stiripentol in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy: a randomised
      placebo-controlled syndrome-dedicated trial. STICLO study group.
PG  - 1638-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiripentol is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 that showed
      antiepileptic efficacy in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI) in
      association with clobazam and valproate in an open study. To confirm these
      results, 41 children with SMEI were included in a randomised, placebo-controlled,
      add-on trial. METHODS: After a baseline period of 1 month, placebo (n=20) or
      stiripentol (n=21) was added to valproate and clobazam during a double-blind
      period of 2 months. Patients then received stiripentol in an open fashion.
      Responders were defined as having more than 50% reduction in the frequency of
      clonic (or tonic-clonic) seizures during the second month of the double-blind
      period compared with baseline. FINDINGS: 15 (71%) patients were responders on
      stiripentol (including nine free of clonic or tonic-clonic seizures), whereas
      there was only one (5%) on placebo (none were seizure free; stiripentol 95% CI
      52.1-90.7 vs placebo 0-14.6). The 95% CI of the difference was 42.2-85.7.
      Percentage of change from baseline was higher on stiripentol (-69%) than on
      placebo (+7%), p<0.0001. 21 patients on stiripentol had moderate side-effects
      (drowsiness, loss of appetite) compared with eight on placebo, but side-effects
      disappeared when the dose of comedication was decreased in 12 of the 21 cases.
      INTERPRETATION: This controlled trial shows the antiepileptic efficacy, of add-on
      stiripentol in children with SMEI. The results also provide good reason to focus 
      studies on a specific epilepsy syndrome-a small sample of patients is sufficient 
      to show the efficacy that might have been missed in a heterogeneous population.

TI  - Effect of counselling mothers on their children's exposure to environmental
      tobacco smoke: randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of behavioural counselling for smoking mothers in
      reducing young children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. DESIGN:
      Randomised double blind controlled trial. SETTING: Low income homes in San Diego 
      county, California. PARTICIPANTS: 108 ethnically diverse mothers who exposed
      their children (aged <4 years) to tobacco smoke in the home. INTERVENTION:
      Mothers were given seven counselling sessions over three months. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Children's reported exposure to environmental tobacco smoke from
      mothers in the home and from all sources; children's cotinine concentrations in
      urine. RESULTS: Mothers' reports of children's exposure to their smoke in the
      home declined in the counselled group from 27.30 cigarettes/week at baseline, to 
      4.47 at three months, to 3.66 at 12 months and in the controls from 24.56, to
      12.08, to 8.38. The differences between the groups by time were significant
      (P=0.002). Reported exposure to smoke from all sources showed similar declines,
      with significant differences between groups by time (P=0.008). At 12 months, the 
      reported exposure in the counselled group was 41.2% that of controls for mothers'
      smoke (95% confidence interval 34.2% to 48.3%) and was 45.7% (38.4% to 53.0%)
      that of controls for all sources of smoke. Children's mean urine cotinine
      concentrations decreased slightly in the counselled group from 10.93 ng/ml at
      baseline to 10.47 ng/ml at 12 months but increased in the controls from 9.43
      ng/ml to 17.47 ng/ml (differences between groups by time P=0.008). At 12 months
      the cotinine concentration in the counselled group was 55.6% (48.2% to 63.0%)
      that of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Counselling was effective in reducing children's
      exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Similar counselling in medical and
      social services might protect millions of children from environmental tobacco
      smoke in their homes.

TI  - Clinical safety of iron-fortified formulas.
PG  - E38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron-fortified formulas are recommended throughout infancy and are
      frequently used beyond, yet safety aspects have been inadequately studied. Iron
      could theoretically increase pro-oxidant stress, with potential adverse effects, 
      including infection risk, and some clinicians suspect that iron-fortified
      formulas induce gastrointestinal disturbance. OBJECTIVE: A planned component of a
      large intervention trial has been to test the hypothesis that infants receiving
      iron-fortified formula do not have a higher incidence of infections (primary
      outcome) or gastrointestinal problems (secondary outcome) than infants on low
      iron-formulas or cow's milk. Methods. Children (n = 493) 9 months old receiving
      cow's milk were recruited in 3 UK centers and randomized to: 1) cow's milk as
      before, 2) formula containing.9 mg/L of iron, or 3) an otherwise identical
      formula but containing 12 mg/L of iron. Children were followed at 3 monthly
      intervals and the episodes of infections, diarrhea and constipation, and general 
      morbidity to 18 months old were recorded. Hematologic indices of iron status were
      determined at 18 months old. RESULTS: Serum ferritin concentrations were
      increased in infants receiving iron-fortified formula but there were no
      intergroup differences in incidence of infection, gastrointestinal problems, or
      in general morbidity or weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify
      adverse health effects in older infants and toddlers consuming a high
      iron-containing formula (12 mg/L) even when used in populations with a low
      incidence of iron deficiency.

TI  - Long-term effects of outpatient rehabilitation of COPD: A randomized trial.
PG  - 976-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the short- and long-term effects of an outpatient pulmonary
      rehabilitation program for COPD patients on dyspnea, exercise, health-related
      quality of life, and hospitalization rate. SETTING: Secondary-care respiratory
      clinic in Barcelona. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with
      blinding of outcome assessment and follow-up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
      Sixty patients with moderate to severe COPD (age 65 +/- 7 years; FEV(1) 35 +/-
      14%) were recruited. Thirty patients randomized to rehabilitation received 3
      months of outpatient breathing retraining and chest physiotherapy, 3 months of
      daily supervised exercise, and 6 months of weekly supervised breathing exercises.
      Thirty patients randomized to the control group received standard care. RESULTS: 
      We found significant differences between groups in perception of dyspnea (p <
      0.0001), in 6-min walking test distance (p < 0.0001), and in day-to-day dyspnea, 
      fatigue, and emotional function measured by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire
      (p < 0. 01). The improvements were evident at the third month and continued with 
      somewhat diminished magnitude in the second year of follow-up. The PR group
      experienced a significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in exacerbations, but not the
      number of hospitalizations. The number of patients needed to treat to achieve
      significant benefit in health-related quality of life for a 2-year period was
      approximately three. CONCLUSION: Outpatient rehabilitation programs can achieve
      worthwhile benefits that persist for a period of 2 years.

TI  - All-artery multigraft coronary artery bypass grafting with only internal thoracic
      arteries possible and safe: a randomized trial.
PG  - 650-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The internal thoracic artery (ITA) bypass to the left anterior
      descending coronary artery is of proven benefit in multigraft coronary artery
      bypass. Total ITA grafts, if reoperation is averted by avoiding saphenous vein
      grafts (SVGs), are attractive. The safety of the total ITA graft operation
      (all-ITA) is a concern. METHODS: A randomized trial of multiple-ITA bypass
      graftings with the use of bilateral sequential ITA without SVGs was performed.
      Control patients received 1 ITA plus SVG. Inclusion criteria were those used in
      the Coronary Artery Surgery Study, extended to age 76 years, and any angina
      class, except emergent. One hundred sixty-two patients were randomized (81
      patients per group) from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1994. RESULTS: Baseline
      traits were similar as were cross-clamp times, pump times, and number of arteries
      bypassed (average, 4.3 arteries). Patients who received multiple ITA grafts had
      no myocardial infarctions, per reference laboratory. One patient died, and 2
      patients returned for bleeding. The ITA-SVG group had similar results. The
      all-ITA group experienced successful completion in 93% of cases. Complications
      did not differ from control patients. CONCLUSIONS: Early and 5-year outcomes were
      not different between the all-ITA group and the ITA with SVGs group. We believe
      experienced surgeons can safely extend the ITA to multibypass coronary artery
      bypass without use of SVG to achieve an all-ITA operation.

TI  - A randomized study comparing standard versus moderately high dose megestrol
      acetate for patients with advanced prostate carcinoma: cancer and leukemia group 
      B study 9181.
PG  - 825-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Megestrol acetate (MA) is a synthetic progestin with reported
      activity in both hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma
      (HRPC). Based on limited data suggesting a possible dose-response effect, a trial
      was initiated to compare standard versus moderately high dose MA in HRPC.
      METHODS: One hundred forty-nine men with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma
      were randomized to receive oral MA either at 160 mg/day (low dose) or 640 mg/day 
      (high dose). Patients were stratified by performance status and measurable versus
      evaluable disease. The primary end point was tumor response. Secondary end points
      were survival, quality-of-life measures, and prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      decline. RESULTS: The median survival times of 11.2 months for patients who
      received the low dose and 12.1 months for patients who received the high dose
      therapy were not significantly different. Best response was equivalent in the 2
      arms: 2 partial responses and 22 patients with stable disease for the 160 mg/day 
      dose, and 1 partial response and 28 patients with stable disease for the 640
      mg/day dose. A greater than 50% decline in PSA occurred in 13.8% and 8.8% of
      patients in the low and high dose treatment arms, respectively. There were no
      differences in the toxicity or quality-of-life outcomes between the two arms.
      Poorer performance status (2 vs. 0-1), greater than 5% weight loss, higher
      baseline PSA, and measurable disease all predicted shorter survival. CONCLUSIONS:
      MA has limited activity in hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma, and there is no
      apparent dose-response correlation.

TI  - A randomized trial of weighted vest use in ambulatory older adults: strength,
      performance, and quality of life outcomes.
PG  - 305-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower extremity weakness is a major risk factor for falls and hip
      fractures. Aging muscle is capable of responding to strengthening techniques.
      Strategies for providing accessible, inexpensive, safe, and effective
      strengthening programs for older adults are needed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate
      whether use of a weighted vest improved strength, physical performance, markers
      of bone turnover, or health-related quality of life. DESIGN: A 27-week
      randomized, controlled, unmasked clinical trial. The primary outcome was peak
      isokinetic knee extensor strength at follow-up, adjusted for baseline strength.
      SETTING: Home-based program. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 62 women and men, mean age 
      74 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized to: no vest (n = 21), 3% body
      weight (BW) vest (n = 19), or 5% BW vest (n = 22). The vest is a nylon garment
      with pockets that are loaded with adjustable weights. The vest was prescribed for
      2 hours daily, 4 days per week. No specific physical activities were mandated.
      MEASUREMENTS: All measures were made at baseline and 27 weeks. These included:
      knee strength and endurance by isokinetic dynamometer; timed physical performance
      tests; serum osteocalcin and urinary N-telopeptides; and health-related quality
      of life scales. RESULTS: Follow-up values of muscular strength and endurance,
      physical performance, bone turnover markers, and health-related quality of life
      did not differ by treatment assignment. The final study visit was attended by 19 
      (90%), 15 (80%), and 20 (91%) of the control, 3%, and 5% groups, respectively.
      Three permanent discontinuations of vest use occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Weighted vest
      use did not result in improvement in multiple domains of strength and function
      and did not affect bone turnover markers. We conclude that the training stimulus 
      afforded by the vest (at the dosage tested) was below the required amount to
      produce strength gains or bone stimulation.

TI  - The rehabilitation of limb apraxia: a study in left-brain-damaged patients.
PG  - 379-88
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a rehabilitative training program for
      patients with limb apraxia. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING:
      Neurologic rehabilitation unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Thirteen
      patients with acquired brain injury and limb apraxia (lasting more than 2 months)
      as a result of lesions involving the left cerebral hemisphere. Patients were
      assigned to a study group or to a control group following a randomization scheme.
      The study group underwent an experimental training for limb apraxia. The control 
      group received conventional treatment for aphasia. INTERVENTION: A behavioral
      training program consisting of gesture-production exercises. The rehabilitative
      program was made up of 3 sections dedicated to the treatment of gestures with or 
      without symbolic value and related or nonrelated to the use of objects.
      Thirty-five experimental sessions, each lasting 50 minutes, were given. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychologic tests for assessment of aphasia, verbal
      comprehension, "general intelligence," oral apraxia, constructional apraxia, and 
      3 tests concerning limb praxic function (ideational apraxia, ideomotor apraxia,
      gesture recognition). Scores related to each test were used to measure the
      outcome. Video recordings of ideational and ideomotor apraxia tests allowed us to
      register type and number of praxic errors. All outcome measures, except the
      aphasia test, were recorded before and after the experimental (or control)
      treatment time interval. RESULTS: The patients in the study group achieved a
      significant improvement of performance in both ideational (p = .039) and
      ideomotor (p = .043) apraxia tests. They also showed a significant reduction of
      errors in ideational (p = .001) and ideomotor (p < .001) apraxia tests. A trend
      toward improvement was found in the gesture comprehension test (p = .058), while 
      other outcome measures did not show any significant amelioration. Control
      patients did not show any significant change in performance. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results show the possible effectiveness of a specific training program for the
      treatment of limb apraxia.

TI  - Continuous positive airway pressure during fiberoptic bronchoscopy in hypoxemic
      patients. A randomized double-blind study using a new device.
PG  - 1063-7
AB  - Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) may worsen oxygenation and clinical status in
      severely hypoxemic patients. We conducted a prospective, randomized double-blind 
      trial to compare the delivery of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as a 
      tool for maintaining oxygenation during FOB, to the delivery of oxygen only.
      Thirty consecutive patients who needed FOB for diagnostic purposes were enrolled.
      Their arterial oxygen pressure (Pa(O(2))) to inspired oxygen fraction (FI(O(2))) 
      ratio was below 300 mm Hg. CPAP was generated by a simple new device open to the 
      atmosphere. During FOB and the 30 min thereafter, pulse oximetry values
      (Sp(O(2))) were significantly higher in the CPAP than the Oxygen group (95.7 +/- 
      1.9% versus 92.6 +/- 3.1, p = 0.02). The lowest Sp(O(2)) values were observed in 
      the Oxygen group (93.5 +/- 2.4% versus 88.6 +/- 3.4, p = 0.002). Arterial blood
      gases 15 min after FOB showed that Pa(O(2)) had increased in the CPAP group and
      decreased in the Oxygen group (DeltaPa(O(2)) = +10.5% +/- 16.9 versus -15% +/-
      16.6, p = 0.01). Five patients in the Oxygen group, but none in the CPAP group,
      developed respiratory failure in the 6 h after FOB and required ventilatory
      assistance (p = 0.03). We conclude that in hypoxemic patients, the use of a new
      CPAP device during FOB allowed minimal alterations in gas exchange and prevented 
      subsequent respiratory failure.

TI  - Treatment of endometriosis with a decreasing dosage of a gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone agonist (nafarelin): a pilot study with low-dose agonist therapy
      ("draw-back" therapy).
PG  - 799-804
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of half-dose GnRH agonist therapy for
      endometriosis. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal pilot study. SETTING: Osaka
      University Hospital. PATIENT(S): Patients with symptomatic endometriosis.
      INTERVENTION(S): Fifteen patients were randomized to receive either full-dose
      nafarelin treatment (200 microgram b.i.d.) for 24 weeks (n = 7) or full-dose
      nafarelin treatment for 4 weeks followed by half-dose nafarelin treatment (200
      microgram daily) for 20 weeks (n = 8). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical symptoms
      and the results of physical examinations. Serum E(2) and carcinoma antigen 125
      (CA125) levels, lipid profiles, and urinary levels of the N-telopeptide of type I
      collagen. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine. RESULT(S): Subjective and
      objective manifestations of endometriosis were decreased to a similar extent in
      both study groups. Adverse effects were markedly reduced with half-dose
      administration. In the half-dose group, the mean serum E(2) level was
      significantly suppressed by 4 weeks of treatment with full-dose nafarelin and
      remained at approximately 30 pg/mL with half-dose nafarelin. Loss of bone mineral
      density was significantly less with half-dose treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Half-dose
      administration of nafarelin after pituitary down-regulation with full-dose
      nafarelin ("draw-back" therapy) is a new protocol for the treatment of
      endometriosis that is effective and associated with fewer adverse effects.

TI  - The value of routine preoperative medical testing before cataract surgery. Study 
      of Medical Testing for Cataract Surgery.
PG  - 168-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine preoperative medical testing is commonly performed in
      patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery, although the value of such
      testing is uncertain. We performed a study to determine whether routine testing
      helps reduce the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative medical
      complications. METHODS: We randomly assigned 19,557 elective cataract operations 
      in 18,189 patients at nine centers to be preceded or not preceded by a standard
      battery of medical tests (electrocardiography, complete blood count, and
      measurement of serum levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and
      glucose), in addition to a history taking and physical examination. Adverse
      medical events and interventions on the day of surgery and during the seven days 
      after surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Medical outcomes were assessed in 9408
      patients who underwent 9626 cataract operations that were not preceded by routine
      testing and in 9411 patients who underwent 9624 operations that were preceded by 
      routine testing. The most frequent medical events in both groups were treatment
      for hypertension and arrhythmia (principally bradycardia). The overall rate of
      complications (intraoperative and postoperative events combined) was the same in 
      the two groups (31.3 events per 1000 operations). There were also no significant 
      differences between the no-testing group and the testing group in the rates of
      intraoperative events (19.2 and 19.7, respectively, per 1000 operations) and
      postoperative events (12.6 and 12.1 per 1000 operations). Analyses stratified
      according to age, sex, race, physical status (according to the American Society
      of Anesthesiologists classification), and medical history revealed no benefit of 
      routine testing. CONCLUSIONS: Routine medical testing before cataract surgery
      does not measurably increase the safety of the surgery.

TI  - Long-term controlled trial of nocturnal nasal positive pressure ventilation in
      patients with severe COPD.
PG  - 1582-90
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the 1-year efficacy of noninvasive positive
      pressure ventilation (NPPV) added to long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in patients 
      with stable severe COPD. PATIENT SELECTION AND METHODS: We prospectively
      randomized 52 patients with severe COPD (FEV(1) < 45%) to either NPPV plus
      "standard care" (96% patients with LTOT) or to standard care alone (93% patients 
      with LTOT). The outcomes measured included the following: rate of acute COPD
      exacerbations; hospital admissions; intubations; and mortality at 3 months, 6
      months, and 12 months. The patients were also evaluated at 3 months and 6 months 
      for dyspnea using the Medical Research Council and Borg scales, gas exchange,
      hematocrit, pulmonary function, cardiac function with echocardiogram, and
      neuropsychological performance. RESULTS: One-year survival was similar in both
      groups (78%). The number of acute exacerbations was similar at all time points in
      patients receiving NPPV, compared with control subjects. The number of hospital
      admissions was decreased at 3 months in the NPPV group (5% vs 15% of patients, p 
      < 0.05), but this difference was not seen at 6 months (18% vs 19%, respectively).
      The only beneficial differences were observed in the Borg dyspnea rating, which
      dropped from 6 to 5 (p < 0.039), and in one of the neuropsychological tests
      (psychomotor coordination) for the NPPV group at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
      indicates that over 1 year, NPPV does not affect the natural course of the
      disease and is of marginal benefit in outpatients with severe COPD who are in
      stable condition.

TI  - Extended-release niacin vs gemfibrozil for the treatment of low levels of
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Niaspan-Gemfibrozil Study Group.
PG  - 1177-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a direct comparison of agents that raise plasma levels of
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to help devise strategies for
      coronary risk reduction. METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind
      trial, we compared the effects of extended-release niacin (Niaspan), at doses
      increased sequentially from 1000 to 2000 mg at bedtime, with those of
      gemfibrozil, 600 mg given twice daily, in raising low levels of HDL-C. Enrollment
      criteria included an HDL-C level of 1.03 mmol/L or less (< or =40 mg/dL), a
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 4.14 mmol/L or less (< or =160
      mg/dL) or less than 3.36 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) with atherosclerotic disease, and a 
      triglyceride level of 4.52 mmol/L or less (< or =400 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 173
      patients, 72 (82%) of the 88 assigned to Niaspan treatment and 68 (80%) of the 85
      assigned to gemfibrozil treatment completed the study. Niaspan, at 1500 and 2000 
      mg, vs gemfibrozil raised the HDL-C level more (21% and 26%, respectively, vs
      13%), raised the apolipoprotein A-I level more (9% and 11% vs 4%), reduced the
      total cholesterol-HDL-C ratio more (-17% and -22% vs -12%), reduced the
      lipoprotein(a) level (-7% and -20% vs no change), and had no adverse effect on
      the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (2% and 0% change vs a 9%
      increase). Significance levels for comparisons between medications ranged from
      P<.001 to P<.02. Gemfibrozil reduced the triglyceride level more than Niaspan
      (P<.001 to P = .06, -40% for gemfibrozil vs -16% to -29% for Niaspan, 1000 to
      2000 mg). Effects on plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly favorable for
      Niaspan compared with gemfibrozil (P<.02), as gemfibrozil increased the
      fibrinogen level (from 5% to 9%) and Niaspan tended to decrease the fibrinogen
      level (from -1% to -6%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a low baseline HDL-C
      level, Niaspan at its higher doses provided up to 2-fold greater HDL-C increases,
      decreases in lipoprotein(a), improvements in lipoprotein cholesterol ratios, and 
      lower fibrinogen levels compared with gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil gave a greater
      triglyceride reduction but also increased the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      level, which did not occur with Niaspan.

TI  - Cognitive and family therapies for adolescent depression: treatment specificity, 
      mediation, and moderation.
PG  - 603-14
AB  - The specificity of cognitive and family therapies, and potential treatment
      mediators and moderators, was examined in a randomized clinical trial for
      adolescent depression. After acute treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
      exerted specific effects on cognitive distortions relative to either
      systemic-behavioral family therapy (SBFT) or nondirective supportive therapy
      (NST). At 2-year follow-up, SBFT was found to impact family conflict and
      parent-child relationship problems more than CBT; NST and CBT tended to show a
      greater reduction in anxiety symptoms than SBFT. Nonspecific therapist variables 
      qualified few outcome analyses. No measures of cognitive distortion or family
      dysfunction mediated or moderated treatment outcome. As in adult studies,
      relatively few areas of treatment specificity or mediation were identified. The
      implications of these findings for clinical treatment and research in adolescent 
      depression are discussed.

TI  - Evidence of platelet activation during treatment with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist in 
      patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes.
PG  - 1514-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study was done to determine the role of partial agonist activity 
      in the lack of effectiveness of the oral GPIIb/IIIa antagonist orbofiban.
      BACKGROUND: Orbofiban, an oral GPIIb/IIIa antagonist, was found to increase the
      mortality of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in the OPUS-TIMI-16
      trial, despite the fact that it is a very potent anti-platelet agent and that IV 
      agents have proven very effective. METHODS: Patients (n = 520) with ACS were
      randomized to orbofiban 30 mg, 40 mg or 50 mg twice daily or 50 mg once daily or 
      placebo. Platelet activity was assessed in 175 patients by examining GPIIb/IIIa
      receptor conformation, expression of CD63 antigen, and platelet aggregation.
      RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of orbofiban at the highest dose (74 +/- 6 ng/ml
      peak, 61 +/- 5 ng/ml trough) exceeded the IC50 for platelet aggregation to
      adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (29 +/- 6 ng/ml) and thrombin-activating peptide (61 
      +/- 18 ng/ml). Orbofiban induced a conformational change in GPIIb/IIIa detected
      as the displacement of the monoclonal antibody mAb2; such conformational changes 
      have been linked to partial agonist activity. Consistent with this, platelet
      expression of CD63 ex vivo was significantly increased at five time points during
      the study. In vitro, orbofiban increased platelet aggregation to a submaximal
      concentration of epinephrine (67 +/- 19% vs. 27 +/- 9%, n = 5) and increased
      thromboxane formation when the platelet GPIIb/IIIa were clustered using
      monoclonal antibodies to the receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Orbofiban is both an
      antagonist and a partial agonist of platelet GPIIb/IIIa. At low concentrations of
      the drug, this partial agonist activity may enhance platelet aggregation. Along
      with suboptimal plasma drug levels, these findings may help explain the lack of
      efficacy seen with orbofiban in patients with ACS.

TI  - Postnatal changes of extracellular volume, atrial natriuretic factor, and
      diuresis in a randomized controlled trial of high-frequency oscillatory
      ventilation versus intermittent positive-pressure ventilation in premature
      infants <30 weeks gestation.
PG  - 2064-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) with a high lung volume
      strategy is an experimental mode of ventilating preterm infants aimed at
      achieving maximal alveolar recruitment Higher mean airway pressures are used
      during HFOV than during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV), and
      the intrathoracic volume increase is relatively constant. Both factors increase
      the risk to depress organ blood flow and diuresis. Our objective was to test the 
      hypothesis that high lung volume HFOV attenuates the postnatal reduction of
      extracellular volume in preterm infants by reducing plasma atrial natriuretic
      factor and diuresis. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. 
      SETTING: University hospital, Level III neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS:
      Premature infants <30 wks gestation requiring intubation for respiratory distress
      syndrome within the first 6 hrs of life; 15 infants (gestational age, 26 [24-29] 
      wks, birth weight 814 [452-1340] g) were randomized to HFOV, 19 infants
      (gestational age 27 [24-39] wks, birth weight 930 [644-1490] g) to IPPV.
      INTERVENTIONS: The randomized mode of ventilation was assigned within 1 hr after 
      intubation. During HFOV mean airway pressure was increased as long as oxygenation
      improved and no lung overinflation was seen on chest radiograph. IPPV rates were 
      > or =60/min. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured extracellular volume
      (sucrose dilution) and atrial natriuretic factor on Day 1 and Day 3. Mean airway 
      pressure, body weight, diuresis, and fluid intake were measured daily. During
      HFOV mean airway pressure was higher at 12 hrs (median 7 cm H2O vs. 4 cm H2O; p =
      .001) and 24 hrs (median 6 cm H2O vs. 3 cm H2O; p = .01). In both groups,
      extracellular volume decreased between Day 1 and Day 3 (HFOV from 428 +/- 126 mL 
      to 344 +/- 145 mL [p = .003], IPPV from 466 +/- 108 mL to 414 +/- 124 mL [p =
      .01]) and diuresis increased (HFOV, from 2.5 +/- 1.7 to 4.6 +/- 0.9 mL/kg/hr [p =
      .001]; IPPV, from 2.8 +/- 1.6 to 4.2 +/- 1.0 mL/kg/hr [p = .01]). Plasma atrial
      natriuretic factor was not decreased in the HFOV group. CONCLUSIONS: High lung
      volume HFOV as primary mode of ventilation in preterm infants <30 wks gestation
      did not result in unwanted fluid retention and a decrease in diuresis in the
      first days of life.

TI  - A randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial comparing multilayer
      bandaging followed by hosiery versus hosiery alone in the treatment of patients
      with lymphedema of the limb.
PG  - 2832-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multilayered, low stretch bandages (MLB) combined with exercises,
      skin care, and manual lymphatic drainage therapy are recommended as an intensive 
      phase of treatment for lymphedema patients. The relative efficacy of each of the 
      components of this comprehensive treatment program have not been determined. This
      study aimed to compare the effect of multilayer bandaging as an initial phase of 
      lymphedema treatment followed by elastic hosiery versus hosiery alone. METHODS: A
      randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial was undertaken in the setting of the
      Lymphedema Clinic, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Ninety women with
      unilateral lymphedema (of the upper or lower limbs) were enrolled in the study.
      The interventions consisted of 18 days of multilayer bandaging followed by
      elastic hosiery or hosiery alone, each for a total period of 24 weeks. The main
      outcome measure was the percentage reduction in excess limb volume. RESULTS: The 
      reduction in limb volume by MLB followed by hosiery was approximately double that
      from hosiery alone and was sustained over the 24-week period. The mean overall
      percentage reduction at 24 weeks was 31% (n = 32) for MLB versus 15.8% (n = 46)
      for hosiery alone, for a mean difference of 15. 2% (95% confidence interval,
      6.2-24.2) (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multilayer bandaging as an initial phase of
      treatment for lymphedema patients, followed by hosiery, achieves greater and more
      sustained limb volume reduction than hosiery alone.

TI  - Comparison of efficacy and side effects of combination therapy of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (benazepril) with calcium antagonist
      (either nifedipine or amlodipine) versus high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy
      for systemic hypertension.
PG  - 1182-7
AB  - The present 2 multicenter studies were designed to evaluate whether patients with
      essential hypertension derived equal benefits from use of combination therapy
      with a calcium antagonist and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as
      from doubling the dose of the calcium antagonist. After a 2-week washout and a
      2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a total of 1,390 patients were treated
      with either nifedipine 30 mg (study 1) or amlodipine 5 mg (study 2) once daily
      for 4 weeks. The 1,079 patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained between
      95 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind therapy with
      amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/ benazepril 20 mg, nifedipine
      30 mg or nifedipine 60 mg (study 1), and amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg,
      amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or amlodipine 10 mg (study 2). 
      Both doses of the calcium antagonist/ACE inhibitor combination therapy lowered
      diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and significantly better than the
      lower dose of calcium antagonist monotherapy (with either nifedipine or
      amlodipine). However, 15% of patients in the nifedipine high-dose monotherapy
      group and 24% in the amlodipine high-dose monotherapy group presented with some
      form of edema. In contrast, the incidence of edema was similar for patients
      treated with both combination therapy and low-dose calcium antagonists. Thus,
      combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor provides blood
      pressure control equal to that of high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy but
      with significantly fewer dose-dependent adverse experiences such as vasodilatory 
      edema. Inc.

TI  - Clinical activity of pleconaril in an experimentally induced coxsackievirus A21
      respiratory infection.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - A randomized, double-blind study assessed the efficacy and safety of pleconaril, 
      a novel antiviral drug with broad-spectrum activity against picornaviruses, in
      the treatment of 33 adults with an experimentally induced viral respiratory
      infection. Subjects received either pleconaril 200 mg twice daily (initial dose
      of 400 mg) or placebo for 7 days. Fourteen hours after receiving the initial dose
      of either pleconaril or placebo, subjects were inoculated intranasally with 100
      plaque-forming units of coxsackievirus A21. Results revealed statistically
      significant reductions in viral shedding in nasal secretions (P<.001), nasal
      mucus production (P=.004), and total respiratory illness symptom scores (P=.013) 
      in pleconaril-treated as compared with placebo-treated subjects. The most common 
      adverse events were nausea and abdominal pain. These data support the safety and 
      efficacy of pleconaril in decreasing the signs and symptoms and viral shedding
      associated with a viral respiratory infection.

TI  - T-Saw laminoplasty for the management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy:
      clinical and radiographic outcome.
PG  - 1788-94
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Independent evaluation of 18 patients with multilevel cervical
      spondylotic myelopathy who underwent threadwire T-saw laminoplasty. OBJECTIVES:
      Assess the efficacy of midline T-saw laminoplasty in non-Japanese patients based 
      on clinical and radiographic criteria. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinous
      process-splitting laminoplasty has been well accepted in Japan. The results in
      non-Japanese patients are unknown. METHODS: A single physician performed
      independent clinical and radiographic evaluations at latest follow-up (mean, 24
      months). In addition to a patient self-assessment questionnaire, objective
      measures included physical examination, Pavlov's ratio, sagittal canal diameter
      (by computed tomography), cord compression index, cervical lordosis, range of
      motion, and complications. RESULTS: Progression of myelopathy was arrested in all
      patients. Patients reported improvement in strength (78%), dexterity (67%),
      numbness (83%), pain (83%), and gait (67%). Bowel and bladder compromise resolved
      in five of six patients. The mean Nurick score improved from 2.7 to 0.9 (P <
      0.001), and the mean Robinson pain score improved from 2.0 to 0.89 (P = 0.002).
      No patient required narcotic analgesics at latest follow-up compared with eight
      before laminoplasty. Objectively, 68% of patients with motor weakness regained
      normal strength (P = 0.001), whereas 50% regained normal sensation (P = 0.003).
      Radiographic canal expansion was verified by a statistically significant increase
      in the mean Pavlov ratio and osseous sagittal computed tomographic measurements. 
      The mean cord compression index improved from 0.49 to 0.61 (P = 0.01). There was 
      no significant change in mean cervical lordosis. Graft dislodgment or segmental
      instability did not occur. Complications included: infection (n = 1) and
      persistent postoperative motor root lesion at C5 (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: T-saw
      laminoplasty appears to be a safe and effective method of arresting the
      progression of myelopathy and allowing marked functional improvement in most
      patients with multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy. [Key Words: cervical

TI  - Assessment of fetal scalp oxygen saturation determination in the sheep by
      transmission pulse oximetry.
PG  - 1549-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic fetal heart rate monitoring has an unacceptable
      false-positive nonreassuring rate, which results in an excess of operative
      interventions. As a more objective measure of fetal oxygenation, fetal scalp
      pulse oximetry has been used to assess fetal blood oxygen saturation (SO (2)).
      The current devices use reflectance oximetry, which has inherent limitations.
      These include varying depths of signal penetration, variation with position, and 
      potential for optical interference. In this study we evaluated a newly developed 
      transmission pulse oximetry device consisting of transmitter and receiver diodes 
      mounted within the coil of a standard scalp electrode (Spiral O(2)CTG;
      Respironics Inc, Marietta, Ga). STUDY DESIGN: Six pregnant ewes at 127 to 135
      days' gestation (term, 145 days' gestation) were anesthetized, intubated, and
      prepared with a femoral artery catheter. Fetuses were prepared with brachial
      artery and jugular vein catheters. Maternal inspired oxygen fraction was titrated
      from 21% to 3%. Oximetry O(2)CTG devices were positioned on the fetal scalp, and 
      recordings were compared with directly determined fetal arterial pH, PO (2), and 
      SO (2) values. RESULTS: Maternal SaO (2) and PaO (2) ranged from 102% to 16% and 
      110 to 18 mm Hg, respectively. Fetal SaO (2) and PaO (2) ranged from 76% to 12%
      and 28 to 8 mm Hg, respectively. There was excellent correlation between direct
      fetal SaO (2) and scalp SO (2) (r (2) = 0.90; scalp SO (2) = 0.79 SaO (2) +
      6.89). With an SaO (2) of <30% as the cutoff point for assessment of fetal
      compromise, scalp SO (2) measurements had a 94% +/- 10% specificity and a 94% +/-
      10% positive predictive value. CONCLUSION: (1) Preliminary studies of the Spiral 
      O(2)CTG sensor demonstrated high correlation of scalp SO (2) with fetal SaO (2). 
      (2) Although potential inaccuracies remain, transmission oximetry may offer
      potential advantages in consistency, ease of application, and technology with
      respect to the current reflection oximeter devices.

TI  - Post-varicella epiglottitis and necrotizing fasciitis.
PG  - e13
AB  - Varicella is a nearly ubiquitous acquired childhood disease. Infectious
      complications of varicella can be life- or limb-threatening. These complications 
      appear 3 to 4 days after the appearance of varicella exanthem and are heralded by
      fever, pain, and erythema of the overlying skin. Airway complications of
      varicella are rare, rapidly evolving, and, unfortunately, difficult to visualize.
      We report a child who presented with a unique combination of varicella-induced
      airway complications-acute epiglottitis and subsequent necrotizing fasciitis of
      the head and neck. varicella, epiglottitis, necrotizing fasciitis, group A

TI  - Moderately early (7-14 days) postnatal corticosteroids for preventing chronic
      lung disease in preterm infants.
PG  - CD001144
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used late in the neonatal period to treat
      chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm babies and early to try to prevent it. CLD 
      is likely to be the result of persisting inflammation in the lung and the use of 
      powerful anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone has some rationale. Early use
      tends to be associated with increased adverse effects so that studies of
      moderately early treatment (7-14 days postnatal) might have the dual benefits of 
      fewer side effects and onset of action before chronic inflammation is
      established. OBJECTIVES: To determine if moderately early (7-14 days) postnatal
      corticosteroid treatment vs control (placebo or nothing) is of benefit in the
      prevention and/or treatment of early chronic lung disease in the preterm infant. 
      SEARCH STRATEGY: Randomised controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid therapy
      were sought from the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Database of
      Controlled Trials, Medline, hand searching paediatric and perinatal journals,
      examining previous review articles and information received from practising
      neonatologists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of postnatal
      corticosteroid treatment from 7-14 days of birth in high risk preterm infants
      were selected for this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data regarding
      clinical outcomes including mortality up to 28 days and before discharge, failure
      to extubate, mortality and / or chronic lung disease at 28 days and 36 weeks, CLD
      at 28 days and 36 weeks, infection, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, severe
      retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), pneumothorax, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), 
      gastrointestinal bleeding, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy, late rescue with dexamethasone and abnormal neurological
      examination at follow-up were abstracted and analysed using Revman 4.0.4. MAIN
      RESULTS: Moderately early steroid treatment (vs placebo or nothing) reduced
      mortality by 28 days, chronic lung disease at 28 days and 36 weeks, and death or 
      chronic lung disease at 28 days or 36 weeks. Earlier extubation was facilitated. 
      There was no significant effect on the rates of pneumothorax, severe ROP, and
      NEC. Adverse effects included hypertension, hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal
      bleeding, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and infection. Steroid-treated infants were
      less likely to need late rescue with dexamethasone. There was only one small
      study of longterm follow-up and it did not show any increase in adverse
      neurological outcome. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Moderately early corticosteroid
      therapy (started at 7-14 days) reduces neonatal mortality and CLD, but at the
      cost of important short term adverse effects. No reliable evidence concerning
      long term effects is provided by the trials included in this review. In view of
      the evidence of an important increase in cerebral palsy and other adverse
      neurodevelopmental outcomes from trials in which postnatal steroid was begun
      either earlier or later than 7-14 days, there are reasonable grounds for
      extending this concern to moderately early initiation of steroid therapy. More
      research is urgently needed, including long term follow-up of survivors included 
      in previous and any future trials, before the benefits and risks of postnatal
      steroid treatment, including initiation at 7-14 days, can be reliably assessed.

TI  - Managing the agitated psychotic patient: a reappraisal of the evidence.
PG  - 11-20
AB  - Under intense public pressure, regulatory agencies have recently defined
      circumstances in which medications will be considered a form of restraint,
      so-called "chemical restraint." This article proposes that the emergency
      management of the agitated patient be viewed as a brief departure from the usual 
      physician-patient collaboration. Viewed in this way, the goal is simply to
      terminate the emergency in the manner most likely to be acceptable to patients
      and conducive to a more typical dialogue. To that end, the author reviews all
      controlled studies of medication treatment of agitation that have appeared in
      English since the advent of the neuroleptic medications. Issues of diagnosis,
      relative efficacy, dosage, route, onset, offset, safety, tolerability, and
      consumer preference are considered.

TI  - Management of ischemic heel ulceration and gangrene: An evaluation of factors
      associated with successful healing.
PG  - 1110-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of
      treatment of nonhealing heel ulcers and gangrene and to define those variables
      that are associated with success. METHODS: A multi-institutional review was
      undertaken at four university or university-affiliated hospitals of all patients 
      with wounds of the heel and arterial insufficiency, which was defined as absent
      pedal pulses and a decreased ankle/brachial index (ABI). Risk factors,
      hemodynamic parameters, and arteriographic findings were statistically analyzed
      to determine their effect on wound healing. Life-table analysis was used to
      assess graft patency and wound healing. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (57 men, 34 
      women) were treated for heel wounds that did not heal for 1 to 12 months (62% of 
      nonhealing wounds, 3 months or longer). The mean preoperative ABI was 0.51, and
      31% of wounds were infected. Of the patients, 55% had impaired renal function (Cr
      > 1.5), with 24% undergoing dialysis, 70% had diabetes, and 64% smoked
      cigarettes. Treatment was topical wound care for all patients and operative wound
      debridement in 50%. Infrainguinal bypass was performed for 81 patients, 4 had
      inflow procedures, 3 had superficial femoral artery percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty, and 3 had primary below-knee amputation. Postoperatively, 85% of
      patients had in-line flow to the foot with at least a single patent vessel, 66%
      had a pedal pulse, and the mean ABI improved by 0.40, to 0.91. Follow-up ranged
      from 1 to 60 months (mean, 21 months), and 77 patients (85%) are currently alive.
      In 66 patients (73%), the wounds healed-all within 6 months (mean, 3 months). For
      14 (16%) the wounds had not healed, and 11 patients (11%) underwent below-knee
      amputation. By life-table analysis, limb salvage was 86% at 3 years. During
      follow-up, 75 infrainguinal bypasses (91%) remained patent (3 secondarily) and 6 
      occluded, with primary assisted patency of 87% at 3 years. All wounds in patients
      with occluded grafts failed to heal. Variables found to be statistically
      significant in predicting healing included normal renal function (95% healed vs
      55% nonhealed, P <.002), a palpable pedal pulse (85% healed vs 42%, P <.0015), a 
      patent posterior tibial artery past the ankle (86% healed vs 57%, P <.02), and
      the number of patent tibial arteries after bypass to the ankle (P <.0001).
      Neither the ABI nor the presence of infection (defined as positive tissue
      cultures or the presence of osteomyelitis), diabetes, or other cardiovascular
      risk factors influenced the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Complete wound healing of
      ischemic heel ulcers or gangrene may require up to 6 months, and short-term graft
      patency is of minimal benefit. Successful arterial reconstruction, especially a
      patent posterior tibial artery after bypass, is effective in treating most heel
      ulcers or gangrene. Patients with impaired renal function are at increased risk
      for failure of treatment, but their wounds may successfully heal and they should 
      not be denied revascularization procedures.

TI  - Vitamin A status and postnatal dexamethasone treatment in bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia.
PG  - 547-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vitamin A (retinol) plays an important role in epithelial regeneration
      during recovery from lung injury in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
      Dexamethasone is used in the postnatal treatment of very low birth weight (VLBW) 
      neonates with BPD. To test the hypothesis that the vitamin A status is critical
      for the beneficial pulmonary response to dexamethasone, we performed a
      prospective cohort study in which we characterized the changes in plasma
      concentrations of vitamin A and retinol-binding protein (RBP) in response to
      dexamethasone, and correlated these changes with the pulmonary outcome. METHODS: 
      VLBW neonates (birth weight <1350 g, gestational age <31 weeks, postnatal age >10
      days), who had presumptive diagnosis of severe BPD and need for high ventilatory 
      support (fraction of inspired oxygen >/=.6, mean airway pressure >/=7 cm H(2)O), 
      were treated with a seven-day course of dexamethasone (.5 mg/kg/d x 2 days,.25
      mg/kg/d x 2 days,.1 mg/kg/d x 3 days). Plasma concentrations of vitamin A and RBP
      were determined sequentially at baseline, and during and after dexamethasone
      treatment. Pulmonary response to dexamethasone was graded daily using a composite
      ventilation score. The changes in plasma vitamin A and RBP concentrations were
      compared between infants with a positive (beneficial) pulmonary response to
      dexamethasone and those with a negative response. RESULTS: Among 23 infants
      studied, 13 showed a positive pulmonary response to dexamethasone, as indicated
      by successful weaning from supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation,
      whereas 10 showed a negative response. A significant, yet short-term, increase in
      plasma concentrations of both vitamin A and RBP was observed in most infants
      treated with dexamethasone. The plasma vitamin A and RBP responses to
      dexamethasone tended to be higher in infants with a positive pulmonary response
      than in those with a negative response. Accounting for gender, a vitamin A
      response with each 10.0 microg/dL increment in plasma vitamin A concentration was
      associated with a 60% increase in the odds favoring a positive pulmonary response
      to dexamethasone. CONCLUSION: Postnatal dexamethasone treatment in VLBW neonates 
      with BPD induces a significant, yet short-term, increase in plasma concentrations
      of both vitamin A and RBP. This increase probably results from endogenous
      mobilization of vitamin A from the liver. Our data suggest that the beneficial
      pulmonary response to dexamethasone in infants with BPD is influenced, at least
      in part, by the vitamin A status, and that gender plays a role in this
      response.vitamin A, dexamethasone, bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

TI  - Lithium augmentation of venlafaxine: an open-label trial.
PG  - 538-43
AB  - The authors conducted an open-label study of the efficacy and tolerability of
      venlafaxine and of lithium augmentation in outpatients with depression who were
      not responding to venlafaxine. Outpatients aged 18 to 70 years were eligible if
      they had a minimum baseline score of 16 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for 
      Depression (HAM-D). Patients were started on venlafaxine 37.5 mg twice daily for 
      1 week. For weeks 2 through 4, the dose of venlafaxine was increased to 75 mg
      twice daily, and for weeks 5 through 7, the dose was further increased to 75 mg
      three times daily. At the end of the 7-week treatment period, patients with a
      <50% decrease in their HAM-D scores from baseline were given lithium carbonate
      600 mg once daily. The dose of lithium carbonate was adjusted to maintain plasma 
      levels in the range of 0.6 to 1.0 mmol/mL. Efficacy was assessed with the 17-item
      HAM-D, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global
      Impressions Scale. Data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. At the end of 
      the 7-week treatment period, 35% of patients showed a > or = 50% decrease in
      their HAM-D scores from baseline. Lithium augmentation was initiated in 23
      patients. The results showed that the addition of lithium was well-tolerated and 
      led to a further decrease in the HAM-D scores, with eight patients responding and
      two of them presenting a remission. The addition of lithium to venlafaxine was
      found to be a well-tolerated strategy in treatment-resistant patients.

TI  - Histological effects of trigeminal nerve radiosurgery in a primate model:
      implications for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery.
PG  - 971-6; discussion 976-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgical treatment of the proximal trigeminal nerve 
      is used to relieve the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. The mechanism of the
      radiosurgical effect is not understood. METHODS: Two adult baboons underwent
      stereotactic magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiosurgery, using a gamma knife.
      A single 4-mm isocenter was targeted to each proximal trigeminal nerve, just
      anterior to the pons, to deliver a maximal dose of 80 or 100 Gy (total of four
      nerves). A nonirradiated baboon brain and nerves served as control specimens. Six
      months after treatment, magnetic resonance imaging was again performed and the
      brains and nerves were studied using light and electron microscopy. RESULTS:
      Magnetic resonance imaging indicated a 4-mm-diameter area of contrast enhancement
      at the target site in each nerve. All irradiated nerves exhibited axonal
      degeneration and mild edema at the target, with remnants of some myelinated
      axons. Large and small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers were affected. No
      inflammation was observed. Nerve necrosis was identified after 100-Gy treatment. 
      The trigeminal ganglion appeared normal. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery at 80 Gy causes
      focal axonal degeneration of the trigeminal nerve. At higher doses, partial nerve
      necrosis is observed. We think that these effects influence the physiological
      features of trigeminal neuralgia.

TI  - Tuberculosis among aboriginal and nonaboriginal persons in British Columbia.
PG  - 151-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare cases of tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed among aboriginal
      persons with a random sample of nonaboriginal persons diagnosed with TB, and
      evaluate the trends in rates of disease between both groups during the same
      period. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: A provincial TB control program.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with TB diagnosed among aboriginal persons in 
      British Columbia between 1992 and 1996 were compared with control patients
      diagnosed during the same period. For each patient a control patient was
      identified. INTERVENTION: The demographic details, type of disease, bacteriology,
      risk factors for TB, therapy received as well as mode of administration were
      documented. The number of contacts identified for each patient as well as the
      number of patients completing chemoprophylaxis were identified. The rates of
      disease during the same period were also documented. RESULTS: During the study,
      202 patients with TB were diagnosed among aboriginal persons and 201 controls
      were chosen. Apart from age at diagnosis (35.1+/-20 years versus 45.7+/-19.7),
      differences in the prevalence of lymphadenopathy (5.9% versus 16.4%, P=0.0008)
      and pleural disease (21.3% versus 16.4%, P=0.00008), there were no differences in
      presentation between aboriginal and nonaboriginal people. Aboriginal people were 
      more likely to have a history of contact with a patient with TB (53% versus
      17.9%, P<0.05), to have received directly observed therapy (55% versus 33.8%,
      P=0.00002) and to have contacts who were purified protein derivative (PPD)
      positive (4+/-9 versus 2+/-3, P=0.002). These contacts were more likely to start 
      isoniazid (2+/-3 versus 1+/-1, P=0.002). Overall, there was a significant decline
      in rates of TB among aboriginal persons compared with the general population, but
      there was a small increase in rates among all subjects in the final year of the
      study. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, significant variations in rates of TB
      among different population groups in British Columbia were found. During the
      study period, there was a greater decline in the rates of TB among aboriginal
      persons. A greater use of directly observed therapy and greater use of
      chemoprophylaxis occurred among aboriginal persons, which may have contributed to
      this decline, or alternatively, it simply reflects the natural evolution of the
      TB epidemic.

TI  - Concepts of mental health--a survey of attendees at a mental health promotion
      conference.
PG  - 83-91
AB  - This survey of attendees at a Mental Health Promotion Conference in Hull,
      Yorkshire, England in the summer of 1996 was undertaken in part fulfilment of an 
      MSc in Health Promotion. Of the 120 delegates, 99 attended the conference. There 
      were 77 completed questionnaires. The most outstanding result of the survey was
      the very strong agreement among respondents that sense of self-worth is the most 
      important attribute of being mentally healthy. The respondents were also strongly
      in favour of enablement strategies but on the whole envisioned these as having
      primarily an educational rather than a societal focus. About a third of the
      respondents tended to conceptualise mental health promotion within a clinical
      framework. The survey demonstrates the need to strengthen concepts of positive
      mental health and for mental health professionals to identify and work more
      closely with non-health workers in the promotion of positive mental health.

TI  - Accuracy of an unattended home CPAP titration in the treatment of obstructive
      sleep apnea.
PG  - 94-7
AB  - Treatment of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) by fixed continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) requires an in-laboratory titration procedure to determine
      the effective pressure level (Peff ). We recently reported that one auto-CPAP
      machine can be used without titration study allowing Peff determination. The aim 
      of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of an auto CPAP trial at home. A 1- or
      2-wk automatic CPAP trial was done at home in 40 patients by estimating the
      reference pressure (Pref ) to be set and a Pref + 3 cm H(2)O/-4 cm H(2)O pressure
      interval. Peff was then determined according to the percentage of CPAP time that 
      was spent </= Pref. This Peff value was set on a fixed CPAP machine for two
      additional weeks and a control sleep study was done. The pressure setting on
      fixed CPAP had to be increased by 1 +/- 1 cm H(2)O (mean +/- SD) above estimated 
      Pref. Sleep improved with fixed CPAP, with a normalization of the apnea +
      hypopnea index (AHI) in 38 of 40 and resumption of diurnal hypersomnolence. CPAP 
      compliance remained excellent (CPAP use: 6.1 +/- 1.7 h/ night) after 6.5 +/- 2.8 
      mo of CPAP treatment. These results indicate that auto-CPAP therapy represents a 
      new useful and accurate way to identify conventional CPAP setting outside
      hospital and sleep laboratories.

TI  - The calcar femorale in cemented stem fixation in total hip arthroplasty.
PG  - 842-5
AB  - The calcar femorale is a vertical plate of bone lying deep to the lesser
      trochanter and is formed as a result of traction of the iliopsoas which separates
      the femoral cortex into two distinct layers, the calcar femorale and the medial
      femoral cortex. They fuse together proximally to form the medial femoral neck. A 
      stem placed centrally will abut against the calcar femorale with little or no
      space for cement. Clearing of the calcar will offer space for a cement layer,
      which will support the stem proximally on the posterior aspect. We compared two
      consecutive groups of Charnley low-friction arthroplasties, with and without
      clearing of the calcar. In 330 patients who had an arthroplasty without clearing 
      the calcar, there were ten revisions for aseptic loosening of the stem and six
      other stems were considered 'definitely loose', giving a rate of failure of 4.8%.
      In 111 patients in whom the calcar was cleared there was only one revision for
      aseptic loosening and no stems were classed as 'definitely loose', giving a rate 
      of failure of 0.9%. Survivorship analysis has again shown the need for long-term 
      follow-up; the differences became clear after ten years but because of the
      relatively small numbers, statistical analysis is not yet applicable. We now
      clear the calcar femorale routinely and advocate optimal access to the medullary 
      canal and insertion of the stem in the area of the piriform fossa.

TI  - Polyglutamine coding genes in bipolar disorder: lack of association with selected
      candidate loci.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that expanded trinucleotide repeats,
      particularly CAG, may have a role in the etiology of BD. Results obtained with
      the repeat expansion detection technique (RED) have indicated that bipolar
      patients have an excess of expanded CAG repeats. However, it is not clear which
      loci account for this difference. METHODS: Using lithium-responsive bipolar
      patients in order to reduce heterogeneity, we investigated five loci that are
      expressed in the brain and contain translated CAG repeats. A sample of 138 cases 
      and 108 controls was studied. Genotypes were coded quantitatively or
      qualitatively and repeat distributions were compared. RESULTS: No difference was 
      found in allele distribution between cases and controls for any of the loci
      studied. In one locus - L10378 - patients had a tendency to present shorter
      alleles (28.1 versus 27.9 repeats; t=2.55, df=205, P=0.011), however, this
      difference disappeared after correction for multiple testing. LIMITATIONS: The
      study has limitations common to most candidate gene association studies, that is,
      limited number of loci investigated and limited power to detect loci that account
      for a small proportion of the total genetic variability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      suggest that the loci investigated have no major role in the genetic
      predisposition to bipolar disorder.

TI  - Adhesio interthalamica in male patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 823-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated whether absence of the adhesio interthalamica
      in patients with schizophrenia constitutes a marker of early developmental
      neuropathological changes. METHOD: Thirty male patients with schizophrenia and 30
      healthy male subjects were recruited for study. Magnetic resonance imaging was
      performed, and the presence or absence of the adhesio interthalamica was
      determined for each subject. The length and volume of the third ventricle were
      also measured. RESULTS: No differences in the presence or absence of the adhesio 
      interthalamica were found between patients with schizophrenia and normal
      comparison subjects. Patients without the adhesio interthalamica had
      significantly higher scores for negative symptoms than patients with the adhesio 
      interthalamica. There was no correlation between absence of the adhesio
      interthalamica and length and volume of the third ventricle in either patients or
      comparison subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that patients with
      schizophrenia who do not have the adhesio interthalamica are characterized by
      more severe negative symptoms.

TI  - Efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for the prevention of sudden 
      death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 365-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease associated with a
      risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death, especially in young
      patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study of the efficacy
      of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in preventing sudden death in 128
      patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who were judged to be at high risk for 
      sudden death. RESULTS: At the time of the implantation of the defibrillator, the 
      patients were 8 to 82 years old (mean [+/-SD], 40+/-16), and 69 patients (54
      percent) were less than 41 years old. The average follow-up period was 3.1 years.
      Defibrillators were activated appropriately in 29 patients (23 percent), by
      providing defibrillation shocks or antitachycardia pacing, with the restoration
      of sinus rhythm; the average age at the time of the intervention was 41 years.
      The rate of appropriate defibrillator discharge was 7 percent per year. A total
      of 32 patients (25 percent) had episodes of inappropriate discharges. In the
      group of 43 patients who received defibrillators for secondary prevention (after 
      cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia), the devices were activated 
      appropriately in 19 patients (11 percent per year). Of 85 patients who had
      prophylactic implants because of risk factors (i.e., for primary prevention), 10 
      had appropriate interventions (5 percent per year). The interval between
      implantation and the first appropriate discharge was highly variable but was
      substantially prolonged (four to nine years) in six patients. In all 21 patients 
      with stored electrographic data and appropriate interventions, the interventions 
      were triggered by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS:
      Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation appears to be the principal mechanism of 
      sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In high-risk patients 
      with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, implantable defibrillators are highly effective
      in terminating such arrhythmias, indicating that these devices have a role in the
      primary and secondary prevention of sudden death.

TI  - The accuracy and reproducibility of radiographic assessment of stress-shielding. 
      A postmortem analysis.
PG  - 1414-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although periprosthetic bone loss remains a major concern in total
      hip arthroplasty, radiographic assessment of such loss is both difficult and
      subjective. In the present study, we assessed the ability of orthopaedic surgeons
      to reproducibly recognize changes in periprosthetic bone density on radiographs. 
      We hypothesized that assessment of periprosthetic bone loss on plain radiographs 
      is not reliable enough to justify its use in outcomes research. METHODS:
      Twenty-nine unilateral total hip replacements and the surrounding bone were
      retrieved at autopsy, and radiographs were made; radiographs of the
      contralateral, normal femur were also made after implantation of an identical
      prosthesis and used as a control. Three orthopaedic surgeons independently
      examined the specimen radiographs and classified bone loss in each of sixteen
      femoral zones. Bone loss was recorded as present if the bone of the femur that
      had had in vivo implantation showed evidence of cortical thinning, increased
      porosity, or decreased density (either cortical or trabecular) when compared with
      the control femur. The kappa coefficient was used to quantify interobserver and
      intraobserver reproducibility in determining bone loss for the 464 zones examined
      and in determining the Engh and Bobyn stress-shielding classification of each
      femur. In fourteen femoral pairs, bone loss was also quantified with dual-energy 
      x-ray absorptiometry, and the resulting value was then compared with the
      bone-loss classification that had been determined radiographically. RESULTS:
      First, the surgeons agreed on the presence or absence of bone loss in 73 percent 
      (337) of the 464 zones. The interobserver kappa value of 0.58 denoted only good
      reproducibility. The intraobserver reproducibility was better; the surgeon's
      initial evaluation of bone loss agreed with his second evaluation for 90 percent 
      of the zones (kappa = 0.74). Second, the three surgeons agreed on the degree of
      stress-shielding, according to the Engh and Bobyn classification, in 66 percent
      (nineteen) of the twenty-nine femora. The kappa value for this comparison was
      only 0.27, indicating marginal reproducibility. Third, although there was some
      agreement among reviewers when there was 20 to 60 percent reduction in
      bone-mineral content as determined with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry,
      excellent agreement among the examiners (kappa = 0.85) was not achieved until
      bone loss averaged 70 percent. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, we
      suggest caution in interpreting results from studies of femoral bone loss that
      have used plain radiographic analysis if the authors have not provided
      interobserver reliability data. We question the utility of evaluating
      periprosthetic bone loss on radiographs, since the loss is not reproducibly
      recognized until 70 percent of the bone is gone.

OAB - PIP: This article focuses on patients' treatment of choice in the area of
      obstetrics and women's health. Given that symptoms, experiences, and expectations
      will differ so greatly from one woman to another, patients' choice in women is a 
      positive development. It is not, however, the only consideration. Concurrent with
      the acceptance of patients' choice has been an explosive increase in the
      scientific knowledge, and in the 1990s, increasingly strident exhortations to
      practice evidence-based medicine. This has not only brought a de-emphasizing
      clinical experience and pathophysiological approaches to disease processes,
      undertaking clinical appraisal exercise, but also brought a completely new
      paradigm. However, ideology, fashion, culture, language, and personal experience 
      will all influence the information doctors and other health workers provide to
      those under their care, as well as the interpretation of this information and the
      decisions taken. Furthermore, financial considerations may considerably modify
      options available for care. Patients will continue to rely on the judgment, the
      wisdom, and the experience of their medical advisers. It is then vital that in
      the course of providing choices for patients, choices should be placed firmly on 
      bases of scientific evidences. Examples of obstetrical and gynecological cases
      and the options available to care are discussed.

TI  - Unstable angina: current concepts of pathogenesis and treatment.
PG  - 25-37
AB  - During the past 15 years, we have learned an enormous amount about the
      pathogenesis and treatment of unstable angina. In most cases of unstable rest
      angina, the pathogenesis is a mural thrombus formation on a ruptured or eroded
      atherosclerotic plaque. However, any process that acutely changes the
      supply-demand ratio (decreased supply or increased demand in the presence of a
      decrease in supply) can precipitate the clinical presentation of unstable angina.
      Standard acute antithrombotic drug therapy is effective in decreasing progression
      to infarction. Newer agents (low-molecular-weight heparin and platelet
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors) are more effective, and their use is evolving. 
      Percutaneous intervention and bypass surgery can reduce symptoms and multiple
      hospitalizations, in most cases without a decrease in the long-term mortality
      rate. Because the cost of hospitalization is extremely high and the clinical
      presentation and outcome are heterogeneous, better triage methods are required.

      depression.
PG  - 992-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether symptoms of striatofrontal dysfunction contribute
      to disability in geriatric depression. DESIGN: Cross-sectional evaluation of the 
      relationship of specific cognitive impairments, psychomotor retardation, severity
      of depression, and medical burden to impairment of instrumental activities of
      daily living. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient services of a psychiatric
      university hospital located in a suburban metropolitan area.Patients. One hundred
      and fifty elderly psychiatric inpatients and outpatients with major depression
      and cognitive function ranging from normal to moderate dementia. MEASURES:
      Psychomotor retardation was evaluated with the Hamilton retardation item and
      executive dysfunction was assessed with the initiation/perseveration (IP) domain 
      of the Dementia Rating Scale. Disability, severity of depression and medical
      burden were assessed with the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Index of
      the Multilevel Assessment Instrument, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and
      the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric, respectively. RESULTS: In the
      entire sample (N = 150) and in the non-demented subjects (N = 101), stepwise
      regression analyses revealed that IP and psychomotor retardation were associated 
      with IADL impairment. Additionally, a 'striatofrontal component', which consisted
      of IP and psychomotor retardation was also significantly associated with IADL
      impairment in the whole sample, as well as in the non-demented patients.
      CONCLUSION: Clinical symptoms and neuropsychological findings associated with
      striatofrontal dysfunction contribute to disability in depressed elderly
      patients.

TI  - An evidence-based approach to the management of uninvestigated dyspepsia in the
      era of Helicobacter pylori. Canadian Dyspepsia Working Group.
PG  - S3-23
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide Canadian primary care physicians with an evidence-based
      clinical management tool, including diagnostic and treatment recommendations, for
      patients who present with uninvestigated dyspepsia. RECOMMENDATIONS: The
      management tool has 5 key decision steps addressing the following: (1) evidence
      that symptoms originate in the upper gastrointestinal tract, (2) presence of
      alarm features, (3) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), (4)
      dominant reflux symptoms and (5) evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection. All
      patients over 50 years of age who present with new-onset dyspepsia and patients
      who present with alarm features should receive prompt investigation, preferably
      by endoscopy. The management options for patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia
      who use NSAIDs regularly are: (1) to stop NSAID therapy and assess symptomatic
      response, (2) to treat with NSAID prophylaxis if NSAID therapy cannot be stopped 
      or (3) to refer for investigation. Gastroesophageal reflux disease can be
      diagnosed clinically if the patient's dominant symptoms are heartburn or acid
      regurgitation, or both; these patients should be treated with acid suppressive
      therapy. The remaining patients should be tested for H. pylori infection, and
      those with a positive result should be treated with H. pylori-eradication
      therapy. Those with a negative result should have their symptoms treated with
      optimal antisecretory therapy or a prokinetic agent. VALIDATION AND EVIDENCE:
      Evidence for resolution of the dyspepsia symptoms was the main outcome measure.
      Supporting evidence for the 5 steps in the management tool and the
      recommendations for treatment were graded according to the strength of the
      evidence and were endorsed by consensus of committee members. If no randomized
      controlled clinical trials were available, the recommendations were based on the 
      best available evidence. LITERATURE REVIEW: Evidence was obtained from MEDLINE
      searches for pertinent articles published from 1966 to October 1999. The searches
      focused on dyspepsia, diagnosis and treatment. Additional articles were retrieved
      through a manual search of bibliographies and abstracts from international
      gastroenterology conferences.

TI  - Biomechanical comparison of quadriceps tendon fixation with patellar tendon bone 
      plug interference fixation in cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PG  - 805-12
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to use current fixation techniques and
      compare the stiffness and ultimate tensile failure of the tendinous end of the
      quadriceps tendon (QT) with the bone plug end of the bone-patellar tendon-bone
      (BPTB) graft using current techniques of fixation. TYPE OF STUDY: Randomized
      trial of elderly cadaver knees. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tibial and femoral
      biodegradable interference fixation and femoral EndoButton (Smith & Nephew,
      Acufex, Mansfield, MA) fixation in bone tunnels with the QT and the BPTB graft
      were compared by using 10 pairs of elderly cadavers and biomechanical testing.
      Two groups, fixation at time zero (simulating fixation in the operating room) and
      testing after 1, 000 loading cycles (simulating patient rehabilitation
      exercises), were used. RESULTS: At time zero fixation, stiffness of the soft
      tissue QT tibial tunnel interference fixation was 59% less stiff than the
      stiffness of the interference fixation of a BPTB plug in a femoral tunnel (P
      =.11). The EndoButton femoral fixation resulted in a decrease in stiffness at
      time zero compared with femoral tunnel interference fixation of the soft tissue
      QT (P =.03). All groups improved stiffness with cycling the construct to 1,000
      cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of the QT tendinous end of the graft in the
      femoral bone tunnel when using a interference fixation will approximate the
      stiffness of a bone plug in the tibial bone tunnel with interference fixation.
      The EndoButton fixation is not as stiff as either of the femoral interference
      fixation options. The addition of more than 20 loading cycles could remove laxity
      from the graft fixation-graft cruciate ligament complex and improve its
      stiffness.

TI  - Changing patterns in the use of the Mental Health Act 1983 in England, 1984-1996.
PG  - 479-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA) is due to be revised by Parliament
      in the near future. AIMS: To explore changes in the use of the Act since its
      introduction. METHOD: The Department of Health and the Home Office routinely
      collect data on the numbers of patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals under
      the MHA. We present absolute figures, by year, for the total numbers admitted
      under each section of the Act. We used the total psychiatric hospital admissions 
      and total prison populations as denominator data. RESULTS: Formal admissions rose
      from 16,044 in 1984 to 26,308 in 1996, a 63% increase. Admissions under the MHA
      have increased as a proportion of all admissions. The increase is mainly
      accounted for by changes in the use of Part II of the Act, in particular sections
      2 and 3. The use of forensic sections (Part III) has also increased, with a
      marked increase of sections 47 and 48. Use of Part X of the Act (sections 135 and
      136) declined in the late 1980s but rose again in the 1990s. CONCLUSIONS: Formal 
      admissions are more common than they were in 1984, despite there being fewer
      psychiatric beds. This is probably due to changes in the provision of psychiatric
      services, and changing societal pressures on psychiatrists away from
      libertarianism and towards coercion.

TI  - Platelet reactivity in depressed patients treated with paroxetine: preliminary
      findings.
PG  - 875-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in platelet reactivity have been previously posited to
      underlie the increased vulnerability of patients with depression to ischemic
      heart disease (IHD). The present study sought to determine whether the increased 
      platelet reactivity associated with major depression is reduced after
      antidepressant treatment. METHODS: Patients diagnosed as having DSM-IV major
      depression (n = 15) (mean age, 37 +/- 7 years; range, 23-48 years) and 12 normal 
      comparison subjects (mean age, 36 +/- 7; range, 23-48 years) were recruited. None
      of the controls or depressed group had evidence of IHD; 10 of 15 patients who
      were depressed had 1 or more traditional IHD risk factors. In vivo platelet
      activation, secretion, and dose-response aggregation of the controls and patients
      was measured after overnight bedrest under basal conditions, and after a mild
      exercise challenge. After 6 weeks of open-label treatment with the selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (20 mg/d), the patients with depression
      were readmitted and procedures of the first General Clinical Research Center
      admission repeated. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, the depressed 
      group exhibited greater procoagulant activity as detected by increased platelet
      binding of the monoclonal antibodies anti-ligand-induced binding site and GA6,
      and increased plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4 under basal conditions. 
      After paroxetine treatment, the patients with depression exhibited significant
      reductions in all 3 parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of platelet activation
      is associated with paroxetine treatment of patients with depression. Because this
      study design did not allow for the determination of whether this effect of
      paroxetine on platelet function is caused by a direct effect of the drug or
      placebo or, alternatively, because of recovery from depression, studies
      containing a placebo and/or psychotherapy treatment arm may resolve this issue.

TI  - The Comorbidity Symptom Scale: a combined disease inventory and assessment of
      symptom severity.
PG  - 1674-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a scale to quantify the presence and severity
      of symptoms arising from comorbid diseases in older people. DESIGN: A validation 
      cohort study of hospital inpatients and outpatients aged 65 years and older.
      SETTING: A Hospital and community in Northeast England. PARTICIPANTS: Development
      of the Comorbidity Symptom Scale-Convenience sample of 50 hospital inpatients and
      outpatients aged 65 years and older. Evaluation of the Comorbidity Symptom Scale-
      Convenience sample of 183 patients aged 65 years and older either awaiting
      cataract surgery or attending a geriatric day hospital. MEASUREMENTS: For
      development of the Comorbidity Symptom Scale, 22 comorbid conditions were
      identified and incorporated into a questionnaire (the CmSS). Evaluation of the
      Comorbidity Symptom Scale-Assessments included the CmSS, activities of daily
      living, perceived health status, and anxiety and depression. RESULTS: A 23-item
      scale was developed. Reliability of the CmSS was demonstrated by a test-retest
      correlation coefficient for the total instrument score of r = 0. 87 (P < .001).
      The CmSS scores correlated with assessments of activities of daily living,
      perceived health status, and anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: The CmSS is a
      simple interviewer-administered tool for use in older people and provides an
      objective measure of the presence of comorbid disease and the patient's
      perception of severity of associated symptoms.

TI  - Inspiratory effort sensation to added resistive loading in patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea.
PG  - 1332-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Repeated episodes of upper-airway occlusion are the main
      characteristics of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during sleep. It
      has been reported that an impairment in the sensation of detection and a
      depression of ventilatory compensation to added load could be observed in such
      patients. In this study, we examined patients with OSA to evaluate the
      inspiratory effort sensation (IES), ventilation, and mouth occlusion pressures
      during added resistive loading while awake and to determine whether they can be
      reversed by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. DESIGN: A
      hospital-based case-control study. SETTING: A sleep laboratory of a medical unit 
      in Japan. SUBJECTS: Seventeen patients with moderate to severe OSA and 10 control
      subjects were included in this study. MEASUREMENTS: All patients with OSA had
      undergone standard nocturnal polysomnography. Patients with OSA and control
      subjects were evaluated for IES measured by a modified Borg score, ventilation,
      and mouth occlusion pressure during control and inspiratory resistive loaded
      breathing. These tests were repeated in all patients with OSA after 2 weeks of
      nasal CPAP treatment. RESULTS: IES to inspiratory resistive loading was lower in 
      patients with OSA than in control subjects. There were no differences in
      ventilation and mouth occlusion pressure between patients and control subjects
      during loaded breathing. After 2 weeks of nasal CPAP, the decreased IES was
      increased in patients with OSA. CONCLUSION: In patients with OSA, the decreased
      IES to inspiratory resistive loaded breathing is reversible with nasal CPAP. This
      could be one additional benefit of nasal CPAP in the treatment of OSA.

TI  - Stroke outcome in double-mutant antioxidant transgenic mice.
PG  - 2685-91
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Both NO and superoxide cytotoxicity are important in
      experimental stroke; however, it is unclear whether these molecules act within
      parallel pathological pathways or as coreagents in a common reaction. We examined
      these alternatives by comparing outcomes after middle cerebral artery occlusion
      in male and female neuronal NO synthase (nNOS)-deficient (nNOS-/-) or human CuZn 
      superoxide dismutase-overexpressing (hSOD1+/-) mice and a novel strain with both 
      mutations. METHODS: Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed by
      use of the intraluminal filament technique (18 hours). Neurological status was
      scored, and tissue infarction volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
      staining and image analysis. RESULTS: Hemispheric infarction volume was reduced
      in each transgenic strain relative to the genetically matched, wild-type, control
      cohorts (WT mice): nNOS-/- (80+/-6 mm(3)) and double-mutant (49+/-6 mm(3)) mice
      versus WT mice (114+/-7 mm(3)) and hSOD1+/- mice (52+/-7 mm(3)) versus WT mice
      (95+/-5 mm(3)). Human CuZn superoxide dismutase had a larger effect on mean
      infarction volume (30% of contralateral hemisphere) than did nNOS deficiency
      (46%). Although infarction volume was less in double-mutant mice compared with
      nNOS-/- mice, injury was not improved relative to hSOD1+/- mice. There was no
      difference in histological damage by sex within each strain; however, female
      nNOS-/- mice were not protected from ischemic injury, unlike male mutants.
      CONCLUSIONS: Superoxide generation contributes to severe ischemic brain injury in
      vivo to a greater extent than does neuronally derived NO. In vivo, significant
      superoxide scavenging by CuZn superoxide dismutase occurs within cellular
      compartments or through biochemical pathways that are not restricted to, and may 
      be distinct from, neuronal NO/superoxide reaction and peroxynitrite synthesis.

TI  - Familial aggregation of Behcet's disease in Turkey.
PG  - 622-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Familial aggregation of Behcet's disease has been reported previously.
      The current study aimed at investigating the sibling recurrence risk ratio
      (lambda s) for Behcet's disease, which is of value in the estimation of the
      magnitude of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease. METHODS:
      170 consecutive unrelated index cases (98 male, 72 female) were interviewed with 
      a detailed questionnaire to ascertain their family trees and the manifestations
      of Behcet's disease in their relatives. Subsequently, the immediately older
      sibling, or if an older sibling was not available, the immediately younger
      sibling, was selected as the second sibling for the evaluation. These siblings
      were contacted by telephone, and all subjects with recurrent oral ulcers were
      invited for examination. RESULTS: 31 of the 170 index cases had 51 relatives
      fulfilling the International Study Group criteria. Among 166 second siblings,
      seven had Behcet's disease (six male, one female) and 22 siblings (eight male, 14
      female) with recurrent oral ulcers were identified. Sibling recurrence
      rate-defined as the ratio of the risk of being affected among the siblings of
      patients and the risk of being affected in the general population- was found to
      be 4.2%, which gives a lambda s value for Behcet's disease of between 11.4 and
      52.5 in Turkey. CONCLUSIONS: A high lambda s value supports a strong genetic
      background for Behcet's disease which will be helpful in designing genetic
      linkage studies.

TI  - The reactions of articular cartilage to experimental wounding: role of apoptosis.
PG  - 215-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the cellular and matrix responses to experimental
      wounding of articular cartilage. METHODS: Immature and mature bovine articular
      cartilage was used as an in vitro model system to study the cellular responses to
      cartilage wounding. Explant cultures were wounded centrally with a trephine and
      maintained for up to 10 days. TUNEL labeling together with ultrastructural
      analyses were used to assess the nature of the observed cell death. In vitro
      labeling with 3H-thymidine was used to detect cell proliferation, and 2
      antibodies (COL2-3/4M and BC-13) were used to detect changes in matrix turnover. 
      RESULTS: Cell death was observed as a response to wounding and was considered to 
      be a combination of necrosis and apoptosis. In immature tissue, cell death was
      more pronounced, particularly in the articular surface region. Within the area of
      cell death, many cells that did not die subsequently underwent proliferation. The
      collagenous network showed evidence of denaturation in the area of the wound, but
      "aggrecanase" activity was not detected. CONCLUSION: There are 2 contrasting, but
      related, responses to cartilage wounding--apoptosis and proliferation. In order
      to improve cartilage repair, future studies need to elucidate the regulatory
      mechanisms that determine these responses.

TI  - Confirmation of subtle motor changes among presymptomatic carriers of the
      Huntington disease gene.
PG  - 1040-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To confirm that subtle changes in motor function and reaction time are
      present in presymptomatic individuals carrying the expanded Huntington disease
      (HD) allele. DESIGN: A case-control, double-blind study comparing presymptomatic 
      HD gene carriers (PSGCs) and nongene carriers (NGCs) at risk for HD. SETTING: The
      Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics at a general clinical research
      center in a midwestern city. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixteen individuals at
      risk for HD who were asymptomatic by self-report and who did not have manifest HD
      on results of clinical examination, including PSGCs (n = 61) and NGCs (n = 155). 
      MEASURES: Molecular testing was used to determine the number of CAG repeats in
      the HD gene. A quantified neurologic examination and a battery of physiological
      measures of central nervous system function measuring speed of movement and
      reaction time were administered. RESULTS: On neurologic examination, the PSGCs
      exhibited significantly more definite or possible abnormalities than NGCs for
      overall oculomotor function, saccade velocity, optokinetic nystagmus, chorea of
      the extremities, and dystonia of the extremities (P<.05). The PSGCs also had
      significantly slower performance for auditory reaction time, visual reaction
      time, visual reaction time with decision, movement time, movement time with
      decision, and button-tapping time, compared with the NGCs (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS:
      Subtle changes in motor function, speed of movement, and reaction time are
      present in HD gene carriers who do not exhibit definite choreiform movements and 
      who do not have sufficient signs to make a clinical diagnosis of HD. In addition,
      a trend toward slower speed of movement and reaction time was observed among this
      population as their neurologic abnormalities increased.

TI  - Nerve growth factor expression is up-regulated in the rat model of
      L-arginine-induced acute pancreatitis.
PG  - 1373-81
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In somatic pain models, increases in nerve growth factor (NGF)
      are linked to the development of pain and hyperalgesia. The aim of this study was
      to examine a rat model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis for changes in NGF
      expression. METHODS: NGF protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the pancreas 
      were correlated with histopathologic changes during the course of acute
      necrotizing pancreatitis in rats induced by the intraperitoneal injection of
      L-arginine. Immunohistochemistry for NGF localization was performed on the
      pancreatic tissue. RESULTS: Two phases of NGF production were observed in the
      inflamed pancreas: an early release from pancreatic islets at 2 and 6 hours and a
      later increase in mRNA (18-fold at maximum) at 3 days and in protein levels
      (7-fold at maximum) at 5 days coinciding with maximum parenchymal necrosis. The
      intense NGF-like immunoreactivity was observed predominantly in the ductal cells 
      in pancreas from rats with pancreatitis at 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: The development
      of acute necrotizing pancreatitis in this model leads to a significant increase
      in NGF production and appears to shift the major cellular sites of NGF production
      from the islets to the ductal cells. It is conceivable that NGF production in the
      inflamed pancreas is responsible for plastic changes in the sensory neurons that 
      mediate peripheral sensitization and contribute to the generation of pain.

TI  - Impact of diabetes on long-term prognosis in patients with unstable angina and
      non-Q-wave myocardial infarction: results of the OASIS (Organization to Assess
      Strategies for Ischemic Syndromes) Registry.
PG  - 1014-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although unstable coronary artery disease is the most common reason
      for admission to a coronary care unit, the long-term prognosis of patients with
      this diagnosis is unknown. This is particularly true for patients with diabetes
      mellitus, who are known to have a high morbidity and mortality after an acute
      myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospectively collected data from 6
      different countries in the Organization to Assess Strategies for Ischemic
      Syndromes (OASIS) registry were analyzed to determine the 2-year prognosis of
      diabetic and nondiabetic patients who were hospitalized with unstable angina or
      non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. Overall, 1718 of 8013 registry patients (21%)
      had diabetes. Diabetic patients had a higher rate of coronary bypass surgery than
      nondiabetic patients (23% versus 20%, P:<0.001) but had similar rates of
      catheterization and angioplasty. Diabetes independently predicted mortality
      (relative risk [RR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.81; P:<0.001), as well as
      cardiovascular death, new myocardial infarction, stroke, and new congestive heart
      failure. Moreover, compared with their nondiabetic counterparts, women had a
      significantly higher risk than men (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.44; and RR, 1.28;
      95% CI, 1.06 to 1.56, respectively). Interestingly, diabetic patients without
      prior cardiovascular disease had the same event rates for all outcomes as
      nondiabetic patients with previous vascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization
      for unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction predicts a high 2-year
      morbidity and mortality; this is especially evident for patients with diabetes.
      Diabetic patients with no previous cardiovascular disease have the same long-term
      morbidity and mortality as nondiabetic patients with established cardiovascular
      disease after hospitalization for unstable coronary artery disease.

PG  - 1899-906
AB  - Many interventions reduce stroke risk. However, the full benefits of these
      interventions are not realized at current levels of utilization, as nearly all
      evidence-based or guideline-endorsed stroke prevention services are underused.
      The cause for such underuse is multifactorial and includes factors relating to
      both patients and providers, as well as to a health care system that has
      de-emphasized prevention at the expense of acute, technologically based care.
      Much like the evidence for stroke interventions themselves, there is a growing
      literature to support methods of implementing research evidence into clinical
      practice. There is still much to learn, however, about the effectiveness of
      interventions aimed at achieving changes in stroke prevention practice or the
      delivery of stroke prevention care. Nevertheless, there are many opportunities
      for providers, managed care organizations, and government to close the
      evidence-practice gap that exists for stroke prevention services. These
      opportunities exist in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, and depend on
      the neurologist taking a leading role in emphasizing the critical importance of
      risk factor identification and modification in all patients at risk for stroke.

TI  - Optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
PG  - 334-8; discussion 339-43
AB  - Subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular
      contracture. Intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or
      other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on 
      wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against
      common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. The purpose
      of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of
      povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions DAB-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin
      B) and DAB-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around
      breast implants. In phase I trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and DAB
      were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants.
      In phase II, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in DAB-1 rather than saline. In
      phase III, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with DAB-2. Efficacy for all
      phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at
      37 degrees C for 48 hours. Povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a
      dilution of 12.5% against Staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against
      Staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against Escherichia coli and
      Pseudomonas, DAB-1 was found to be ineffective against S. epidermidis but
      effective against S. aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, E. coli, and Pseudomonas.
      In phase II trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in DAB was effective
      at killing all experimental bacteria. In phase III trials, 10% povidone-iodine in
      DAB-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. In conclusion, to maximize
      bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the
      detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin
      may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the
      incidence of capsular contracture.

TI  - A comparison of observational studies and randomized, controlled trials.
PG  - 1878-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: For many years it has been claimed that observational studies find
      stronger treatment effects than randomized, controlled trials. We compared the
      results of observational studies with those of randomized, controlled trials.
      METHODS: We searched the Abridged Index Medicus and Cochrane data bases to
      identify observational studies reported between 1985 and 1998 that compared two
      or more treatments or interventions for the same condition. We then searched the 
      Medline and Cochrane data bases to identify all the randomized, controlled trials
      and observational studies comparing the same treatments for these conditions. For
      each treatment, the magnitudes of the effects in the various observational
      studies were combined by the Mantel-Haenszel or weighted analysis-of-variance
      procedure and then compared with the combined magnitude of the effects in the
      randomized, controlled trials that evaluated the same treatment. RESULTS: There
      were 136 reports about 19 diverse treatments, such as calcium-channel-blocker
      therapy for coronary artery disease, appendectomy, and interventions for
      subfertility. In most cases, the estimates of the treatment effects from
      observational studies and randomized, controlled trials were similar. In only 2
      of the 19 analyses of treatment effects did the combined magnitude of the effect 
      in observational studies lie outside the 95 percent confidence interval for the
      combined magnitude in the randomized, controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS: We found
      little evidence that estimates of treatment effects in observational studies
      reported after 1984 are either consistently larger than or qualitatively
      different from those obtained in randomized, controlled trials.

TI  - Skeletal muscle morphology and exercise response in congenital generalized
      lipodystrophy.
PG  - 1545-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is an autosomal recessive
      genetic disorder characterized by almost complete absence of adipose tissue,
      muscular appearance, and severe insulin resistance since birth. We investigated
      whether insulin resistance in CGL patients is associated with abnormal muscle
      morphology and whether increased muscularity imparts increased muscle strength
      and exercise capacity RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We obtained quadriceps muscle 
      biopsies to study muscle fiber types and capillary density in three
      African-American women (aged 17-20 years) with CGL. We also assessed quadriceps
      muscle strength, muscle metabolism, and maximal O2 consumption in the patients.
      RESULTS: Quadriceps muscle biopsies revealed a markedly higher percentage of type
      II (fast-twitch glycolytic) muscle fibers in patients with CGL versus sedentary
      young women (75-78 vs. 47-57%, respectively). The capillary-to-fiber ratio
      (2.7-3.0), however, was normal. Cross-sectional areas of type I (slow-twitch
      oxidative) (1,262-2,685 microm2) and type II (2,304-3,594 microm2) fibers were
      far below the normal values (3,811-4,310 and 3,115-4,193 microm2, respectively), 
      suggesting muscle hyperplasia but not hypertrophy The quadriceps muscle strength,
      as measured by Cybex, was below average; the maximal O2 consumption (23-32 ml x
      kg(-1) x min(-1)) was also below average. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy of the forearm muscles revealed normal pH and metabolic responses to
      static and dynamic exercises. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that insulin resistance in
      patients with CGL is associated with an increased proportion of type II muscle
      fibers but not reduced capillary density. Increased muscularity in CGL is due to 
      muscle hyperplasia and is not associated with increased muscle strength.

TI  - Functional effect of the C242T polymorphism in the NAD(P)H oxidase p22phox gene
      on vascular superoxide production in atherosclerosis.
PG  - 1744-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased superoxide anion production increases oxidative stress and 
      reduces nitric oxide bioactivity in vascular disease states. NAD(P)H oxidase is
      an important source of superoxide in human blood vessels, and some studies
      suggest a possible association between polymorphisms in the NAD(P)H oxidase CYBA 
      gene and atherosclerosis; however, no functional data address this hypothesis. We
      examined the relationships between the CYBA C242T polymorphism and direct
      measurements of superoxide production in human blood vessels. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Vascular NAD(P)H oxidase activity was determined in human saphenous
      veins obtained from 110 patients with coronary artery disease and identified risk
      factors. Immunoblotting, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and DNA
      sequencing showed that p22phox protein, mRNA, and 242C/T allelic variants are
      expressed in human blood vessels. Vascular superoxide production, both basal and 
      NADH-stimulated, was highly variable between patients, but the presence of the
      CYBA 242T allele was associated with significantly reduced vascular NAD(P)H
      oxidase activity, independent of other clinical risk factors for atherosclerosis.
      CONCLUSIONS: Association of the CYBA 242T allele with reduced NAD(P)H oxidase
      activity in human blood vessels suggests that genetic variation in NAD(P)H
      oxidase components may play a significant role in modulating superoxide
      production in human atherosclerosis.

TI  - Obtaining informed consent of patients at risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
PG  - 1182-3
AB  - Thirty psychiatrists completed a mailed questionnaire about their attitudes
      toward obtaining informed consent and about the frequency with which they
      obtained it from patients taking neuroleptic medications who were at risk of
      tardive dyskinesia, a relatively common but nonfatal side effect, and neuroleptic
      malignant syndrome (NMS), an uncommon but potentially fatal side effect. Only one
      psychiatrist reported always or almost always informing patients about the risk
      of NMS. Psychiatrists were significantly less likely to inform patients about the
      risk of NMS than the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Psychiatrists may not be aware
      of the risk of NMS and may not know what information to provide to patients.

TI  - Sudden infant death syndrome in child care settings.
PG  - 295-300
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the United
      States has decreased with decreased prone sleeping. Extrapolating from Census
      Bureau data, approximately 7% of SIDS should occur in organized child care
      settings (ie, child care centers or family child care homes). However, 2 states
      have reported higher rates of SIDS in child care. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
      percentage of SIDS deaths occurring in child care settings, and to ascertain
      associated factors. DESIGN: A retrospective study of SIDS deaths from January
      1995 through June 1997 was conducted. Data were abstracted from SIDS databases in
      11 states. Characteristics of SIDS cases occurring in child care settings,
      including sleep position, were compared with those occurring in the care of
      parents. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed.
      RESULTS: A total of 1916 SIDS cases were analyzed for this study. Of these
      deaths, 20.4% occurred in child care settings. Compared with deaths in the care
      of parents, those occurring in child care settings were more likely to occur on
      weekdays between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM; infants were older; not black; and their
      mothers were more educated. Infants in child care were more likely to be found
      prone in univariate analysis, but the association was not significant in multiple
      logistic regression analysis. However, in multiple regression analysis, infants
      in child care were more likely to be last placed prone or found prone, when the
      usual sleep position was side or supine. CONCLUSION: A large proportion (20.4%)
      of SIDS cases occur in child care settings. Factors associated with SIDS in child
      care settings include older age, race, and highly educated parents. Previous
      studies have reported that unaccustomed prone sleeping puts infants at high risk 
      for SIDS; this characteristic was found to be associated with SIDS in child care 
      and may partly explain the high proportion of SIDS cases in child care settings. 
      Parents must discuss sleep position with any caretakers of their infants. In
      addition, further efforts to educate child care providers about the importance of
      supine sleep for infants must be ongoing.

TI  - Transient changes in the synthesis of nitric oxide result in long-term as well as
      short-term changes in acetic acid-induced writhing in mice.
PG  - 103-11
AB  - A single injection of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibitors prevents the
      development of persistent hyperalgesia induced by various manipulations,
      suggesting that NO precipitates long-term changes in nociception. We examined the
      possibility that inhibition of NOS may also be sufficient to produce long-term
      decreases in nociceptive assays, such as writhing, that are known to be sensitive
      to the short-term effects of NOS inhibitors. We characterized short- and
      long-term effects of NOS inhibitors, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME) or
      7-nitro indazole (7-NI) injected intrathecally (i.t.) in mice on acetic
      acid-induced writhing. Doses of L-NAME that had no effect on hot plate or tail
      flick latencies inhibited writhing (0. 01-30 nmol) as well as spinal nNOS
      activity (5 and 100 nmol) when injected i.t. 60-90 min before testing.
      Anti-nociception was not mimicked by D-NAME but was prevented by
      co-administration with the NO precursor, L-arginine. Injection i.t. of 7-NI (30
      min), a selective inhibitor of neuronal NOS (nNOS), inhibited NOS activity in the
      spinal cord and produced anti-nociception, confirming that writhing is sensitive 
      to inhibition of nNOS. Although the acute action of both NOS inhibitors
      dissipated completely by 3-6 h, a delayed and prolonged inhibition of writhing
      was again observed 24 h after L-NAME (5-100 nmol), a time when spinal NOS
      activity was no longer inhibited by L-NAME (5 and 100 nmol) or 7-NI (25 nmol).
      This novel effect appears to be initiated by the transient inhibition of nNOS as 
      delayed anti-nociception was mimicked by 7-NI at doses (10-100 nmol) that no
      longer inhibited spinal nNOS (25 nmol) at 24 h. Co-administration with L-arginine
      prevented the delayed (24 h) anti-nociceptive effects of L-NAME (30 nmol).
      L-Arginine (30 and 100 nmol) was without effect on nociception when administered 
      alone 60 min or 24 h prior to testing. Together these data indicate that brief
      changes in the activity of nNOS induce both long- as well as short-term changes
      in nociception.

TI  - Treatment of fibromyalgia with antidepressants: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 659-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a common, poorly understood musculoskeletal pain
      syndrome with limited therapeutic options. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review
      the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of fibromyalgia and examine
      whether this effect was independent of depression. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of
      English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Studies were obtained
      from searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PSYCLIT (1966-1999), the Cochrane Library,
      unpublished literature, and bibliographies. We performed independent duplicate
      review of each study for both inclusion and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS:
      Sixteen randomized, placebo-controlled trials were identified, of which 13 were
      appropriate for data extraction. There were 3 classes of antidepressants
      evaluated: tricyclics (9 trials), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (3
      trials), and S-adenosylmethionine (2 trials). Overall, the quality of the studies
      was good (mean score 5.6, scale 0-8). The odds ratio for improvement with therapy
      was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.6 to 6.8). The pooled risk
      difference for these studies was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.34), which calculates to
      4 (95% CI, 2.9 to 6.3) individuals needing treatment for 1 patient to experience 
      symptom improvement. When the effect on individual symptoms was combined,
      antidepressants improved sleep, fatigue, pain, and well-being, but not trigger
      points. In the 5 studies where there was adequate assessment for an effect
      independent of depression, only 1 study found a correlation between symptom
      improvement and depression scores. Outcomes were not affected by class of agent
      or quality score using meta-regression. CONCLUSION: Antidepressants are
      efficacious in treating many of the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Patients were more 
      than 4 times as likely to report overall improvement, and reported moderate
      reductions in individual symptoms, particularly pain. Whether this effect is
      independent of depression needs further study.

TI  - Laparoscopic or conventional Nissen fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal reflux 
      disease: randomised clinical trial. The Netherlands Antireflux Surgery Study
      Group.
PG  - 170-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: For the surgical treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux disease
      (GORD), laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has largely replaced the open
      procedure. Retrospective and prospective non-randomised studies have shown
      similar results after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication compared with the open
      procedure. METHODS: In a multicentre randomised trial candidates for surgical
      treatment of GORD were randomly assigned to either laparoscopic or open 360
      degrees Nissen fundoplication. Primary endpoints were dysphagia, recurrent GORD, 
      and intrathoracic hernia. Secondary endpoints were effectiveness and quality of
      life. This planned interim analysis focuses on endpoints and complications and
      in-hospital costs. FINDINGS: At the time of interim analysis, 11 patients in the 
      laparoscopic group and one in the conventional group had reached a primary
      endpoint (p=0.01; relative risk=8.8, 95% CI 1.2-66.3). This difference was caused
      mainly by whether or not patients had dysphagia (seven patients in the
      laparoscopic group and none in the conventional group, p=0.016). INTERPRETATION: 
      Although laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was as effective as the open
      procedure in controlling reflux, the significantly higher risk of reaching a
      primary endpoint in the laparoscopic group led us to stop the study.

TI  - Electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients treated with clozapine.
PG  - 441-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular side effects of clozapine are not uncommon, but few
      systematic studies of these effects have been performed. In this study, we
      reviewed data on the electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in patients treated
      with clozapine. METHOD: Sixty-one patients treated with clozapine were selected
      from the Seoul National University Hospital Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia
      Clinic. A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify ECG abnormalities 
      and cardiovascular side effects. RESULTS: The prevalence of ECG abnormalities in 
      patients who had been using antipsychotics other than clozapine was 13.6% at
      baseline, which increased significantly to 31.1% after commencement of clozapine 
      treatment. Among the 53 patients without baseline ECG abnormalities, 13 showed
      new-onset ECG abnormalities after using clozapine. Normal ECG under previous
      antipsychotic medication reduced the risk of new-onset ECG abnormalities, whereas
      increased age was found to increase the risk. The occurrence of orthostatic
      hypotension or tachycardia was not related to the development of ECG
      abnormalities. Most of the newly developed abnormalities had little clinical
      significance, and they tended to occur during the initial phase of treatment. In 
      10 patients, ECGs normalized despite the continued use of clozapine. Clozapine
      increased corrected QT interval (QTc) in a dose-dependent fashion; however, the
      clinical significance of this observation is uncertain. Pathologic prolongation
      of QTc was found to be rare. CONCLUSION: Although a substantial portion of
      patients treated with clozapine developed ECG abnormalities, most of the
      abnormalities were benign and did not hinder further treatment.

TI  - Perineal application of talc and cornstarch powders: evaluation of ovarian cancer
      risk.
PG  - 720-4
AB  - Some epidemiologic studies have reported associations between perineal talc
      exposure and epithelial ovarian cancer, which raises parallel questions about the
      consequences of perineal exposure to cornstarch. Cornstarch powder is an
      alternative to talc powder that by its nature is a completely different
      substance. In this review of the literature the epidemiologic data on ovarian
      cancer risk and perineal application of both powders are reviewed, and the
      chemical natures of the two powders are compared. All available data indicate
      that whereas associations between talc exposure and ovarian cancer have suggested
      but not proved a casual relationship, the application of perineal powder
      containing cornstarch exclusively is not predicted to be a risk factor for
      ovarian cancer.

TI  - Immunological tolerance to inhaled antigen.
PG  - S169-74
AB  - Regulatory mechanisms exist in the immune system to limit the induction of
      pathogenic responses to antigens encountered within the respiratory tract. The
      development of allergic disease is thought to arise as a result of the breakdown 
      in these regulatory processes. In this review we examine the nature of immune
      responses generated to inhaled protein antigens and the mechanisms used to
      establish tolerance to inhaled antigens.

TI  - Chlamydia pneumoniae does not influence atherosclerotic plaque behavior in
      patients with established carotid artery stenosis.
PG  - 2930-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Research for infectious agents in the etiology of
      atherosclerosis has identified Chlamydia pneumoniae as a possible candidate.
      While there is evidence of an association between presence of this microorganism 
      and atherosclerosis, it is unclear whether infection has a genuinely etiologic
      role in this disease, whether its presence influences clinical outcomes, and, if 
      so, at which stages of disease this occurs. We have approached this issue in
      patients with advanced carotid artery atherosclerosis using molecular biological 
      detection methods and clinically relevant indicators of pathology in carotid
      artery atheroma to determine whether the presence of C pneumoniae correlates with
      plaque instability. METHODS: C pneumoniae was detected with the use of a
      sensitive nested polymerase chain reaction. Preoperative embolization and
      preoperative infarcts were recorded with the use of transcranial Doppler
      insonation of the middle cerebral artery and cerebral CT, respectively. RESULTS: 
      C pneumoniae DNA was detected in 25.5% of a cohort of 98 symptomatic patients.
      There was no significant difference in plaque stability as measured by
      embolization rates between the chlamydial-positive and -negative specimens. There
      was also no correlation between the number of ipsilateral hemispheric infarcts in
      the territory of the middle cerebral artery and chlamydial status. CONCLUSIONS:
      This study confirms that C pneumoniae is a common finding in atherosclerotic
      plaques of the carotid artery but suggests that the presence of the infectious
      organism has little detectable impact on plaque instability when measured by
      clinically significant markers. This raises important questions for the rationale
      of antibiotic therapy in atherosclerosis.

TI  - DNA vaccination to treat autoimmune diabetes.
PG  - 285-92
AB  - In numerous animal models, DNA immunization has been shown to induce protective
      immunity against infectious diseases (viral, bacterial and protozoan) and cancers
      (1, 2). In these situations it is desirable to induce a strong immune response to
      the DNA-encoded antigen in order to generate an immune memory that enables the
      vaccine to respond more rapidly to subsequent challenge. The success of DNA
      vaccination in this regard has led to its rapid introduction into several human
      clinical trials (3, 4). However, in autoimmunity, undesirable immune responses to
      autoantigens are thought to lead to the destruction of target cells or organs,
      resulting in diseases such as myasthenia gravis, diabetes or multiple sclerosis. 
      Thus, at first sight, it appears that immunization would more likely trigger
      autoimmunity than ameliorate it. Nevertheless, clinical experience has shown that
      certain immune-mediated diseases may be countered by low-dose antigen
      administration ('desensitization'), although the underlying mechanisms remain
      somewhat conjectural. Here, we will describe an intriguing approach to the
      prevention of autoimmune disease, in which we use a DNA vaccine encoding a
      self-antigen to abrogate autoimmune diabetes. The success of this strategy relies
      on the nature of the immune response induced by the DNA vaccine.

TI  - Sense of coherence and lack of control in relation to outcome after orthopaedic
      injuries.
PG  - 751-6
AB  - This study aimed to investigate whether sense of coherence (SOC) and lack of
      control are related to outcome after moderate orthopaedic injuries. One hundred
      and eleven patients with orthopaedic injuries were included. The patients were
      followed up 1 year after the injury (physical examination, Disability Raring
      Index (DRI), Visual Analogue Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory and SF-36). At a 
      minimum of 2 years after the injury, the patients filled out a questionnaire,
      which included three SOC questions and one question about sense of lack of
      control. The results showed that a low sense of coherence, sense of having less
      control over one's life, and signs of depression were associated with an
      increased risk of having a less good clinical and functional outcome 1 year after
      the injury (odds ratios varied between 2 and 11). We conclude that these factors 
      seem to be predictive of the outcome and should be taken into consideration when 
      designing rehabilitation programs for injured patients.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of two mental status tests in the older chinese: influence
      of education and age on cut-off values.
PG  - 234-41
AB  - AIMS: To (1) establish the clinical usefulness of the 10-item Abbreviated Mental 
      Test (AMT) and the 18-item Chinese Mini-Mental Status Examination (CMMSE) for
      detecting cognitive impairment associated with dementia in the elderly Chinese;
      (2) determine how the tests' optimal cut-off scores varied with the patients'
      educational level and age; and (3) evaluate which was the more accurate test.
      METHODS: 151 cognitively-healthy, community dwelling elderly Chinese subjects and
      95 elderly Chinese outpatients with dementia were administered the AMT and CMMSE.
      Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the tests'
      optimal cut-off scores for each of the education-by-age subgroups and their
      areas-under-the-curve were compared non-parametrically to evaluate which test was
      more accurate. RESULTS: Both the AMT and CMMSE could identify cognitive
      impairment accurately, but higher cut-off values were necessary for the younger
      and more educated cohort, while lower values were adequate for the older and less
      educated subgroup. The AMT appeared to reach a ceiling effect in the more
      educated categories. The diagnostic accuracies of the two instruments were
      statistically equivalent; there was a trend, however, for the CMMSE to be
      performing better in the more educated subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: To maximise the
      diagnostic efficiency of these two clinically useful mental status tests, it is
      important to adjust their cut-off scores for the patients' education and age.
      Though no clear superiority of either instrument was established in this study,
      we recommend the AMT for patients with 0-6 years of education, whereas for those 
      with greater levels of literacy, we think it better to administer the CMMSE.

TI  - The Trent regional arthroplasty study. Experiences with a hip register.
PG  - 944-7
AB  - We have assessed the usefulness of a regional hip register in the assessment of
      the outcome of primary total hip replacement (THR). Over 97% of THRs performed in
      the Trent region in 1990 were captured onto the register and the inaccuracies
      recorded were less than 1.8%. In an independent assessment of 2111 patients five 
      years after THR, 85.9% of those available for assessment responded, and 66.8%
      agreed to an assessment. The cost of this independent assessment at five years,
      utilising a regional hip register, was approximately l50 per implant. This is a
      reasonable outlay to identify problems early. Some form of registration and
      outcome assessment should be performed on a national level.

TI  - Predicting prognosis after stroke: a placebo group analysis from the National
      Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA Stroke Trial.
PG  - 952-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physicians are often asked to predict outcome after acute stroke.
      Very little information is available that can reliably predict the likelihood of 
      severe disability or death. OBJECTIVE: To develop a practical method for
      predicting a poor outcome after acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Data from the
      placebo arms of Parts 1 and 2 of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
      and Stroke rt-PA [recombinant tissue plasminogen activator] Stroke Trial were
      used to identify variables that could predict a poor outcome, defined as
      moderately severe disability, severe disability, or death (Modified Rankin Scale 
      score >3) 3 months after stroke. RESULTS: Baseline variables that predicted poor 
      outcome were the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) >17 plus atrial fibrillation, yielding 
      a positive predictive value (PPV) of 96% (95% CI, 88 to 100%). The best predictor
      at 24 hours was NIHSS >22, yielding a PPV of 98% (95% CI, 93 to 100%). The best
      predictor at 7 to 10 days was NIHSS >16, yielding a PPV of 92% (95% CI, 85 to
      99%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a severe neurologic deficit after acute ischemic
      stroke, as measured by the NIHSS, have a poor prognosis. During the first week
      after acute ischemic stroke, it is possible to identify a subset of patients who 
      are highly likely to have a poor outcome. These findings require confirmation in 
      a separate study.

TI  - Changes of the hemostatic network in critically ill patients--is there a
      difference between sepsis, trauma, and neurosurgery patients?
PG  - 445-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the time course of coagulation data in intensive care
      patients. DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive study. SETTING: Clinical investigation
      on a surgical and neurosurgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.
      PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with severe trauma (injury severity score, 15 to 25), 
      15 sepsis patients secondary to major surgery, and 15 neurosurgery patients
      (cancer surgery) were studied. INTERVENTIONS: Standardized intensive care
      therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Standard coagulation data and molecular
      markers of coagulation activation and fibrinolytic activity (soluble
      thrombomodulin, protein C, free protein S, thrombin/antithrombin III complex,
      plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complex, tissue plasminogen activator, platelet
      factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin were measured from arterial blood samples on the
      day of admission to the intensive care unit (trauma/neurosurgery patients) or on 
      the day of diagnosis of sepsis (baseline value) and serially during the next 5
      days. Antithrombin III, fibrinogen, and platelet counts were highest in
      neurosurgery patients but without significant differences between sepsis and
      trauma patients. Thrombin/antithrombin III complex increased in the sepsis
      patients (from 22.6+/-4.2 microg/L to 39.9+/-6.8 microg/L), but decreased in
      trauma (from 40.2+/-5.1 microg/L to 17.6+/-4.0 microg/L) and neurosurgery
      patients (from 28.2+/-4.2 microg/L to 16.2+/-3.8 microg/L). Tissue plasminogen
      activator increased in the sepsis patients (from 14.4+/-3.9 microg/L to
      20.7+/-3.8 microg/mL) and remained almost unchanged in the other two groups.
      Soluble thrombomodulin plasma concentration increased significantly in the sepsis
      group (max, 131.8+/-22.5 ng/mL), while it remained elevated in the trauma (max,
      75.5+/-5.9 ng/mL) and was almost normal in the neurosurgery patients. Protein C
      and free protein S remained decreased only in the sepsis group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Alterations of the hemostatic network were seen in all three groups of critically
      ill patients. Hemostasis normalized in the neurosurgery patients and
      posttraumatic hypercoagulability recovered within the study period. By contrast, 
      monitoring of molecular markers of the coagulation process demonstrated abnormal 
      hemostasis in the sepsis patients during the entire study period indicating
      ongoing coagulation disorders and abnormalities in fibrinolysis in these
      patients.

TI  - Chemokine signaling in inflammation.
PG  - N13-26
AB  - The events that lead to an inflammatory response are characterized by recognition
      of the site of injury by inflammatory cells, specific recruitment of
      subpopulations of leukocytes into tissue, removal of the offending agent and
      "debridement" of the injured cells/tissue, and repair of the site of injury with 
      attempts to reestablish normal parenchymal, stromal, and extracellular matrix
      relationship. The molecular regulation of this complex physiologic process
      involves the interaction between cell surface, extracellular matrix, and soluble 
      mediators, such as chemokines. Chemokine activities are mediated through
      G-protein coupled receptors. This is the largest known family of cell-surface
      receptors, which mediate transmission of stimuli as diverse as hormones,
      peptides, glycopeptides, and chemokines. In this review, we will focus on the
      signaling pathways involved in the production and function of chemokines as they 
      relate to the inflammatory response.

AB  - This study examined the role of the therapeutic alliance between client and
      therapist on group treatment outcome in 70 husband-to-wife violent couples.
      Strength of husbands' alliance assessed at Session 1 was positively associated
      with treatment outcome, as measured by decreased husband-to-wife mild and severe 
      psychological and physical aggression. Strength of wives' alliance was unrelated 
      to treatment outcome. Finally, although alliance was related to treatment
      outcome, it was unrelated to treatment completion.

TI  - Relation of glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint destruction in rheumatoid
      shoulder. A 15 year follow up study.
PG  - 158-60
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relation of glenohumeral (GH) and acromioclavicular
      (AC) joint involvement in a cohort of 74 patients with seropositive and erosive
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) followed up prospectively. METHODS: At the 15 year
      follow up radiographs of 148 shoulders were evaluated, and the grade of
      destruction of GH and AC joints were assessed by the Larsen method. One GH joint 
      arthroplasty had been performed after 13 years of the disease onset and the
      preoperative radiograph was evaluated. RESULTS: Erosive involvement (Larsen grade
      >/= 2) was observed in 96 of 148 (65%) of the shoulders. Both GH and AC joints
      were affected in 62 of 148 (42%) shoulders. GH joint alone was involved in nine
      (6%) shoulders and only AC joint was affected in 25 (17%) shoulders. AC joint
      destruction correlated with the GH joint destruction, r=0.74 (95% confidence
      intervals (CI) 0.65 to 0.80 ). CONCLUSION: In RA AC joint is affected more often 
      than the GH joint, but in half of the patients both joints are involved. This
      should be remembered when treating painful rheumatoid shoulder.

TI  - Tumor volume change as a predictor of chemotherapeutic response in osteosarcoma.
PG  - 200-8
AB  - The change in osteosarcoma tumor volume after preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy 
      and its relationship to the histopathologic response was investigated using
      various reproducible volumetric methods. Tumor volume was measured before and
      after chemotherapy in 41 patients with osteosarcoma using an ellipsoid formula in
      plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional magnetic
      resonance imaging measurement. Based on intraobserver and interobserver
      variability for the volumetric measurements of each method, three-dimensional
      magnetic resonance imaging measurement was the most reproducible. In
      three-dimensional magnetic resonance measurements, the correlation of the
      histopathologic response with absolute and relative total tumor volume changes
      and extraosseous volume change were significant. The good responder group showed 
      a greater reduction in tumor volume after chemotherapy, although there was no
      significant difference in pretreatment tumor volume between the good and poor
      responder groups. The group with a decreased or stable tumor volume represented a
      good histopathologic response with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 76%, and 
      positive predictive value of 88%. The change in tumor volume of osteosarcoma
      measured by three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging could predict
      histopathologic response after three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - Fatigue in persons with renal failure who require maintenance haemodialysis.
PG  - 1132-42
AB  - Fatigue is a highly prevalent symptom experienced by persons who live with
      chronic illness, including those with renal failure who require maintenance
      haemodialysis. Fatigue, however, is a non-specific and invisible symptom and is a
      phenomenon that is poorly understood by health care professionals. This study
      examined the symptom of fatigue as experienced by a group of 39 adult
      haemodialysis patients. The theory of unpleasant symptoms formed the conceptual
      framework for the study. A descriptive correlational design was utilized to
      examine fatigue from an inductive approach, considering relevant physiological,
      psychological and situational variables based on a review of the literature. Data
      were collected using a structured self-report questionnaire and biochemical data 
      from retrospective monthly blood tests. The results of the study indicated that
      high levels of fatigue are experienced, with correspondingly low levels of
      vitality, in all the areas measured - general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced 
      motivation, reduced activity and mental fatigue, by adult haemodialysis patients.
      Individual variation was noted in the dimensions of fatigue predominantly
      expressed. Fatigue was significantly associated with the presence of symptoms
      such as sleep problems, poor physical health status and depression. No
      associations between fatigue and the biochemical and situational variables
      measured were noted. Further examination of the data revealed complex
      relationships between the physiological and psychological factors examined.
      Depression was significantly associated with physical health status, sleep
      problems, symptoms and anxiety. Correlations were also noted between symptoms and
      poor physical functioning, sleep problems and depression. Based on the results, a
      revised version of the theory of unpleasant symptoms relating to fatigue is
      presented.

TI  - CT detection of hepatic and splenic injuries: usefulness of liver window
      settings.
PG  - 1107-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the usefulness of liver window
      settings when performing abdominal CT for the detection and characterization of
      hepatic and splenic injuries. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated
      helical abdominal CT scans for hepatic and splenic injuries in 300 consecutive
      patients with blunt abdominal trauma over a 4-month period. There were 204 males 
      and 96 females with a mean age of 34 years (age range, 1-87 years). For each
      patient, initial CT diagnosis of hepatic or splenic injury was made from images
      obtained with standard abdominal window settings. CT scans were then immediately 
      reinterpreted using additional images obtained at narrow window width (liver
      windows). Changes in conspicuity and characterization of injury were recorded.
      All CT examinations were performed with helical 7-mm collimation at a pitch of
      1.5 after oral ingestion of diluted barium and during bolus IV administration of 
      125 mL of ioversol at a rate of 2-3 mL/sec. RESULTS: We detected hepatic or
      splenic injuries in 34 patients (11.3%). There were 19 hepatic injuries and 18
      splenic injuries. Three patients had injuries to both liver and spleen.
      Conspicuity of hepatic or splenic injuries was mildly increased (+1 H) on liver
      windows in 16 patients, whereas the injury was equally conspicuous on both liver 
      window and standard window images in 19 cases. In no case did review of the liver
      windows result in a change in grade of injury or reveal an injury that was not
      seen on standard abdominal window images. The total increased cost for printing
      liver windows was $5748. CONCLUSION: Routine use of liver window settings for
      abdominal CT in trauma patients has little clinical usefulness and is not
      cost-effective.

TI  - Nerve transfer to the median nerve using parts of the ulnar and radial nerves in 
      the rabbit--effects on motor recovery of the median nerve and donor nerve
      morbidity.
PG  - 329-35
AB  - In this study, motor re-innervation of the median nerve by transfer of one-third,
      one-half, and two-thirds of either the agonistic ulnar nerve or the antagonistic 
      radial nerve was investigated in both extremities of 20 rabbits. Recipient median
      nerve: Muscle contraction force of the flexor digitorum sublimus muscle after a
      one-third and a one-half of the ulnar nerve transfer achieved an average of 75
      and 97% muscle power respectively as compared to conventional end-to-end
      neurorrhaphy. Muscle contraction force after one-third or one-half of the radial 
      nerve transfer was significantly lower (36%). Donor nerves: Extensor carpi
      radialis muscle or flexor carpi ulnaris muscle contraction force 6 months
      postoperatively demonstrated a significant decrease after a one-half ulnar nerve 
      and a two-thirds ulnar or radial nerve transfer, but not after a one-third
      transfer of either radial or ulnar nerves. Histologically, the number of axons in
      the re-innervated median nerve and both donor nerves distal to the coaptation
      site seemed to follow variable patterns. It was concluded that in the rabbit use 
      of one-third of the agonistic ulnar nerve for re-innervation of the median nerve 
      results in useful motor recovery with negligible donor site morbidity.
      Clinically, this technique may offer an alternative option for proximal nerve
      injuries or for free functioning muscle transplantations.

TI  - Platelets induce sinusoidal endothelial cell apoptosis upon reperfusion of the
      cold ischemic rat liver.
PG  - 183-91
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sinusoidal endothelial cell (SEC) apoptosis is a central
      feature of reperfusion injury in liver transplantation. Platelet sequestration
      occurs after transplantation with possible deleterious effects. We tested the
      hypothesis that platelets mediate SEC apoptosis. METHODS: Livers were perfused
      after 24 hours of cold preservation in University of Wisconsin solution in an
      isolated perfused rat liver model. The perfusate contained isolated syngeneic red
      blood cells and purified platelets. Effects of inhibiting platelet adhesion on
      SEC apoptosis was tested using sialyl Lewis-X oligosaccharide (sLe(x)), a natural
      ligand of selectin adhesion molecules. Reperfusion injury was assessed by
      established markers of injury. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL and electron
      microscopy. RESULTS: A third of the circulating platelets was rapidly sequestered
      in the liver after reperfusion. This was associated with increased graft injury. 
      Single platelets were adherent to sinusoidal lining without morphological or
      dynamic evidence of impairment of microcirculation. TUNEL staining revealed a
      6-fold increase in the number of apoptotic SECs at 1 hour of reperfusion. No
      hepatocyte death or evidence of necrosis was detected up to 3 hours of
      reperfusion. Addition of sLe(x) inhibited adhesion and significantly reduced SEC 
      apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Platelets cause SEC apoptosis upon reperfusion of liver
      grafts. Prevention of adhesion is protective.

TI  - A computed tomographic scan assessment of endotracheal suctioning-induced
      bronchoconstriction in ventilated sheep.
PG  - 1898-904
AB  - This study was directed at assessing changes in bronchial cross-sectional surface
      areas (BCSA) and in respiratory resistance induced by endotracheal suctioning in 
      nine anesthetized sheep. Cardiorespiratory parameters (Swan-Ganz catheter),
      respiratory resistance (inspiratory occlusion technique), BCSA, and lung aeration
      (computed tomography) were studied at baseline, during endotracheal suctioning,
      and after 20 consecutive hyperinflations. Measurements performed initially at an 
      inspired oxygen fraction (FI(O(2))) of 0.3 were repeated at an FI(O(2)) of 1.0.
      At an FI(O(2)) of 0.3, endotracheal suctioning resulted in atelectasis, a
      reduction in BCSA of 29 +/- 23% (mean +/- SD), a decrease in arterial oxygen
      saturation from 95 +/- 3% to 87 +/- 12% (p = 0.02), an increase in venous
      admixture from 19 +/- 10% to 31 +/- 19% (p = 0. 006), and an increase in lung
      tissue resistance (DR(rs)) (p = 0. 0003). At an FI(O(2)) of 1.0, despite an
      extension of atelectasis and an increase in pulmonary shunt from 19 +/- 5% to 36 
      +/- 2% (p < 0.0001), arterial O(2) desaturation was prevented and BCSA decreased 
      by only 7 +/- 32%. A recruitment maneuver after endotracheal suctioning entirely 
      reversed the suctioning-induced increase in DR(rs) and atelectasis. In three
      lidocaine-pretreated sheep, the endotracheal suctioning-induced reduction of BCSA
      was entirely prevented. These data suggest that the endotracheal
      suctioning-induced decrease in BCSA is related to atelectasis and
      bronchoconstriction. Both effects can be reversed by hyperoxygenation maneuver
      before suctioning in combination with recruitment maneuver after suctioning.

TI  - Do executive function deficits differentiate between adolescents with ADHD and
      oppositional defiant/conduct disorder? A neuropsychological study using the Six
      Elements Test and Hayling Sentence Completion Test.
PG  - 403-14
AB  - Two neuropsychological measures of executive functions--Six Elements Tests (SET) 
      and Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT)--were administered to 110
      adolescents, aged 12-15 years. Participants comprised four groups: Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) only (n = 35). ADHD and Oppositional
      Defiant Disorder/Conduct Disorder (ODD/CD) (n = 38), ODD/CD only (n = 11), and a 
      normal community control group (n = 26). Results indicated that adolescents with 
      ADHD performed significantly worse on both the SET and HSCT than those without
      ADHD, whether or not they also had ODD/CD. The adolescents with ADHD and with
      comorbid ADHD and ODD/CD were significantly more impaired in their ability to
      generate strategies and to monitor their ongoing behavior compared with
      age-matched controls and adolescents with ODD/CD only. It is argued that among
      adolescents with clinically significant levels of externalizing behavior
      problems, executive function deficits are specific to those with ADHD. The
      findings support the sensitivity of these two relatively new tests of executive
      functions and their ecological validity in tapping into everyday situations,
      which are potentially problematic for individuals with ADHD.

AB  - Atherosclerotic vascular diseases are expected to remain the major cause of
      mortality and morbidity globally well into the 21st century. Preventive measures 
      by lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, smoking cessation, prevention of obesity
      and diabetes) will play an important role in retarding the onset of these
      diseases. A strategy aimed at identifying high risk individuals - those with
      established coronary artery disease or other vascular diseases - will provide the
      most cost effective means of preventing cardiovascular events. The high risk
      strategy is aimed at identification of healthy subjects with multiple
      cardiovascular risk factors, identification of those with diabetes,
      identification of those with genetic lipoprotein disorders and initiation of
      treatment with medications if necessary. Categorical risk factors should be
      treated because of the lifetime increase in cardiovascular risk.

TI  - End-of-life care in the pediatric intensive care unit after the forgoing of
      life-sustaining treatment.
PG  - 3060-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the attitudes and practice of clinicians in providing
      sedation and analgesia to dying patients as life-sustaining treatment is
      withdrawn. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case series of 53 consecutive patients who
      died after the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in the pediatric intensive
      care unit at three teaching hospitals in Boston. Data on the reasons why
      medications were given were obtained from a self-administered anonymous
      questionnaire completed by the critical care physician and nurse for each case.
      Data on what medications were given were obtained from a review of the medical
      record. RESULTS: Sedatives and/or analgesics were administered to 47 (89%)
      patients who died after the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Patients who
      were comatose were less likely to receive these medications. Physicians and
      nurses cited treatment of pain, anxiety, and air hunger as the most common
      reasons, and hastening death as the least common reason, for administration of
      these medications. Hastening death was viewed as an "acceptable, unintended side 
      effect" of terminal care by 91% of physician-nurse matched pairs. The mean dose
      of sedatives and analgesics administered nearly doubled as life-support was
      withdrawn, and the degree of escalation in dose did not correlate with
      clinician's views on hastening death. CONCLUSION: Clinicians frequently escalate 
      the dose of sedatives or analgesics to dying patients as life-sustaining
      treatment is withdrawn, citing patient-centered reasons as their principle
      justification. Hastening death is seen as an unintended consequence of
      appropriate care. A large majority of physicians and nurses agreed with patient
      management and were satisfied with the care provided. Care of the dying patient
      after the forgoing of life-sustaining treatment remains underanalyzed and needs
      more rigorous examination by the critical care community.

      than the Wada test. Postoperative language deficits were more consistent with
      Wada results. Available methods for inducing speech arrest with rTMS do not
      replicate the results of Wada tests.

TI  - Direct expenditures related to otitis media diagnoses: extrapolations from a
      pediatric medicaid cohort.
PG  - E72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of otitis media in children is associated with substantial 
      expenditures because of its high frequency during childhood. Vaccines against
      respiratory pathogens causing otitis media are now being developed. Information
      about otitis media-related medical expenditures will be needed to determine the
      cost-effectiveness of these preventive interventions. METHODS: This study used
      utilization data from claims to impute otitis media-related expenditures for
      medical visits, pharmaceuticals, and surgical procedures for 87 057 children 13
      years of age and younger who were continuously enrolled in Colorado's
      fee-for-service Medicaid program during 1992. International Classification of
      Disease, Ninth Revision diagnostic codes were used to identify visits for otitis 
      media. An antibiotic was considered to have been prescribed to treat otitis media
      if it was dispensed up to 24 hours before or within 48 hours after a physician
      encounter showing a diagnosis of otitis media. All tympanostomies,
      mastoidectomies, and adenoidectomies were assumed to be related to otitis media. 
      Expenditures were imputed from utilization using a Medicaid fee schedule.
      National expenditures for 1992 to treat otitis media were extrapolated from
      Colorado's Medicaid data. We adjusted for differences between Colorado and the
      United States as a whole in terms of price, number, and intensity of services;
      for differences in reimbursement rates by service between Medicaid and private
      insurance; and for differences in utilization between Medicaid enrollees and the 
      uninsured. To provide a more current expression of medical expenditures for
      otitis media, we inflated the 1992 expenditure estimates to 1998 dollars using
      the Consumer Price Index published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. RESULTS:
      Twenty-eight percent of children experienced at least 1 episode of diagnosed
      otitis media. The proportion of children with a diagnosis of otitis media was
      highest (42%-60%) in the 7-month to 36-month age range. The proportion was also
      higher among white (34.5%) and Hispanic (25.3%) children than among black
      children (18.5%), as well as among rural (34.5%) compared with urban children
      (27.2%). Children 19 to 24 months of age incurred the highest total annual
      expenditures per child with otitis media ($239.68). Expenditures for drugs,
      visits, and procedures were all highest for this group. The per-patient cost to
      Medicaid was greater for visits than for drugs or procedures across all age
      groups. Total per-patient expenditures were higher for males ($174.67) than for
      females ($154.47) and higher for white children ($176.59) than for Hispanic
      ($154.12) or black children ($134.44). The differences among the ethnic groups
      can be attributed almost entirely to differences in expenditures for procedures
      and drugs. Although mean expenditures per patient varied substantially by some
      patient characteristics (eg, race), these differences accounted for only a small 
      fraction of the enormous variation in costs per patient. Including children with 
      and without otitis media, age-specific estimated expenditures per child peaked
      among children 1 ($132.94) and 2 years of age ($88.72). Children 3 to 6 years of 
      age incurred expenditures only one third as great as those incurred by children 1
      year of age. Total national expenditures were estimated to have been
      approximately $4.1 billion in 1992 dollars and $5.3 billion in 1998 dollars. Over
      40% of national expenditures to treat otitis media in children younger than 14
      years of age were incurred for children between 1 and 3 years of age ($453 per
      capita in 1992 dollars over these 2 years vs $1027 for all years of age from 2 to
      13). Nationally, expenditures for visits remained the largest component of
      expenditures. LIMITATIONS: This study assessed expenditures from the point of
      view of the health care system; that is, no social costs, such as lost work time,
      or expenditures not normally covered by insurance, such as those for
      transportation, we

      messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using
      real-time quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and
      correlated IL-8 mRNA expression in tumor and nontumor lung samples from 58
      patients with NSCLC (29 with squamous cell carcinoma and 29 with adenocarcinoma, 
      of whom 20 had Stage I, 10 had Stage II, and 28 had Stage III disease) with these
      patients' clinicopathologic characteristics, angiogenesis, and outcome. IL-8
      protein expression and tumor microvessel count (MC) were assessed
      immunohistochemically. IL-8 mRNA expression was significantly greater in tumor
      tissue; high expression was highly associated with tumor in advanced stages (p = 
      0.03), distant lymph node metastasis (p = 0.02), high tumor MC (> 123) (p =
      0.00003), short survival (< 26 mo) (p < 0.00001), and early relapse (< 16 mo) (p 
      < 0.00001). Tumor MC correlated strongly with IL-8 mRNA expression (r = 0.56, p <
      0.001). Multivariate analysis showed IL-8 mRNA expression and intratumor MC to be
      the most important predictors of patient survival and relapse. Thus, in NSCLC,
      IL-8 mRNA expression is strongly associated with tumor progression, tumor
      angiogenesis, survival, and time to relapse, suggesting its use as a prognostic
      indicator.

TI  - Plasma alpha-glutathione S-transferase: a sensitive indicator of hepatocellular
      damage during polymicrobial sepsis.
PG  - 198-203
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Since studies have found the liver enzyme alpha-glutathione
      S-transferase (alphaGST) to be a marker of hepatic injury after hemorrhagic
      shock, alphaGST also may serve as a sensitive indicator of hepatocellular damage 
      during the early stage of polymicrobial sepsis. DESIGN, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Male adult rats were subjected to the cecal ligation and
      puncture (CLP) model of polymicrobial sepsis or sham operation, followed by fluid
      resuscitation with isotonic sodium chloride solution. Systemic blood samples were
      taken at 2, 5, 10, or 20 hours after CLP or sham operation. Plasma levels of
      alphaGST and lactate were determined using an enzyme immunoassay and enzymatic
      assay, respectively. Additional animals were examined for morphologic alterations
      in liver ultrastructure of septic animals using electron microscopy. RESULTS: A
      similar level of alphaGST (mean +/- SEM, 30.5 +/- 3.5 microg/L) was found in the 
      sham group at all measured time points. Although plasma levels of alphaGST did
      not change at 2 hours after CLP, they were elevated by 249% at 5 hours after the 
      onset of sepsis and continued to increase throughout the septic course. Plasma
      lactate levels were significantly increased only at 20 hours after CLP (P<.001). 
      Previous studies have shown that liver transaminase levels did not increase at 5 
      hours, but at 10 and 20 hours after CLP. In addition, electron microscopy
      revealed structural changes in hepatocyte morphology at 5 and 20 hours after CLP 
      that were indicative of hepatocellular injury. CONCLUSION: Since plasma alphaGST 
      levels increased earlier than plasma lactate and liver transaminase levels,
      alphaGST may be a more sensitive indicator of early liver injury and should be
      used in monitoring hepatocellular damage during the progression of sepsis.

TI  - Sun protection counseling for children: primary care practice patterns and effect
      of an intervention on clinicians.
PG  - 155-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe current primary care sun protection advice for children
      and assess the effect on clinicians of an intervention to enhance their sun
      protection advocacy. SETTING: Primary care practices caring for children in New
      Hampshire with special attention to clinicians serving 10 towns that were
      involved in a randomized controlled trial of the multicomponent SunSafe
      intervention involving schools, recreation areas, and primary care practices.
      DESIGN/INTERVENTION: A statewide survey of all primary care clinicians serving
      children addressed their self-reported sun protection advocacy practices.
      Clinicians in 10 systematically selected rural towns were involved in the
      subsequent intervention study. The primary care intervention provided assistance 
      to practices in establishing an office system that promoted sun protection advice
      to children and their parents during office visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sun
      protection promotion activities of primary care clinicians as determined by their
      self report, research assistant observation, and parent interviews. RESULTS: Of
      261 eligible clinicians responding to the statewide survey, about half provide
      sun protection counseling "most of the time" or "almost always" during summer
      well care visits. Pediatricians do so more often than family physicians.
      Clinicians involved in the intervention increased their use of handouts, waiting 
      room educational materials, and sunscreen samples. Compared with control town
      parents, parents in intervention towns reported an increase in clinician sun
      protection advice. CONCLUSIONS: The SunSafe primary care intervention increased
      sun protection counseling activities of participating clinicians. A single-focus 
      preventive service office system is feasible to include in community
      interventions to promote sun protection.

TI  - Community-perceived benefits of ivermectin treatment in northeastern Nigeria.
PG  - 1451-6
AB  - A 3-step approach involving focus group discussion, structured interviews and
      informal conversations with key individuals was used to investigate community
      usage and perceived benefits of ivermectin in nine Nigerian villages
      participating in a WHO-sponsored investigation of community-directed treatment
      with ivermectin (CDTI). Only 27% of 284 persons interviewed had received
      treatment. An under-estimation of the district's ivermectin needs led to
      inadequate supply of ivermectin to the communities, which was cited as the main
      reason (65%) for non-treatment. All those treated (N=76) were further interviewed
      using questionnaires. Worm expulsion (80%) and blindness prevention (68%) were
      the most frequently stated benefits. Other perceived benefits were an increase in
      vitality (68%), sexual drive and performance (29%). The sudden relief from a
      heavy burden of worms, which had built up over a long period, may have indirect
      effect on all aspects of an individual's health and account for the diverse
      experiences. The feeling of vitality, good appetite and general health following 
      ivermectin treatment is an animating experience to many communities. Health
      planners face the challenge of preparing communities for fewer 'sensational'
      experiences and preventing a possible feeling of disappointment that may result
      from frequent usage.

TI  - Effects of inverse ratio ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure in
      oleic acid-induced lung injury.
PG  - 1537-45
AB  - Continuous as well as cyclic (with each expiration) lung collapse in acute
      respiratory failure can be reduced by positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or 
      short expiration times, as in inverse ratio ventilation (IRV). In 20 pigs with
      oleic acid-induced lung edema, we compared the effects of a PEEP of 20 cm H(2)O
      with IRV, using an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 3:1 without external PEEP. 
      During IRV, expiration times of 0.5 or 1.0 s were obtained with respiratory rates
      of 30 breaths/min or 15 breaths/min, respectively. In 15 animals,
      ventilation-perfusion relationships were studied through the multiple inert gas
      elimination technique, and lung morphology was studied with computed tomography. 
      In another five pigs, blood flow distribution was studied with perfusion
      scintigraphy. All three ventilatory modes had similar effects on mean arterial
      blood pressure, cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and mean airway pressure. PEEP
      reduced shunt and improved oxygenation to a greater extent than the two modes of 
      IRV, although there was a large variation within each group. The improvement,
      irrespective of which ventilatory mode was superior in a particular pig, was
      caused by greater and more even aeration of the lung, whereas the perfusion
      distribution with PEEP was the same as with IRV. Thus, the strategy of
      stabilizing the lungs through short expiration times, as in IRV, did not offer
      any advantages in our lung injury model.

TI  - Southwest Oncology Group Study of paclitaxel and carboplatin for advanced
      transitional-cell carcinoma: the importance of survival as a clinical trial end
      point.
PG  - 2537-44
AB  - PURPOSE: The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin for the treatment of
      advanced transitional-cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urothelium has promising
      activity and acceptable toxicity. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the
      efficacy of this regimen in a cooperative group setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-nine patients with advanced TCC were treated every 21 days with paclitaxel
      200 mg/m(2), administered as a 3-hour infusion, followed by carboplatin dosed to 
      an area under the curve of 5. Prior systemic adjuvant or neoadjuvant
      platinum-based therapy was not permitted unless completed at least 1 year before 
      enrollment. Patients were evaluated for response every three cycles, and
      follow-up was conducted to determine survival. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were
      enrolled and were assessable. Four (14%) had received prior adjuvant or
      neoadjuvant therapy. Node-only disease was present in 24%, and 76% of patients
      had extranodal disease. The median number of cycles received was five. Grade 4
      toxicity consisted primarily of neutropenia (38% of patients). Neurologic
      toxicity was noted in 16 patients (grade 1 in four patients, grade 2 in five
      patients, grade 3 in six patients, and grade 4 in one patient). Six partial
      responses and no complete responses were noted, for a response proportion of
      20.7% (95% confidence interval, 8% to 40%). Median progression-free survival time
      was 4 months, and overall survival time was 9 months. CONCLUSION: The combination
      of paclitaxel and carboplatin for the treatment of advanced TCC is reasonably
      well tolerated. However, a response proportion considerably lower than that
      previously reported was noted. In addition, the median survival time of 9 months 
      was less than the survival time previously reported for patients treated with the
      combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. Although
      our results may reflect enrollment of patients with poor prognostic features,
      they also call into question the utility of this regimen.

TI  - The co-occurrence of correct and incorrect HIV transmission knowledge and
      perceived risk for HIV among women of childbearing age in El Salvador.
PG  - 1267-78
AB  - This article examines the co-occurrence of correct and incorrect knowledge about 
      documented and undocumented modes of HIV transmission among women of childbearing
      age in El Salvador, and the relationship between HIV transmission knowledge and
      perceived risk. Incorrect beliefs about HIV transmission co-occur at high levels 
      with, and are largely independent of, accurate knowledge about documented modes
      of transmission. The co-occurrence of correct and incorrect HIV transmission
      knowledge was shown to have important implications for perceived risk. Both
      correct and incorrect HIV transmission knowledge increased the odds of risk
      perception; uncertainty about risk was decreased among those with higher levels
      of correct knowledge and increased among those with higher levels of incorrect
      knowledge. Among those who considered themselves to be at some risk for HIV,
      higher levels of correct knowledge reduced uncertainty about the degree of risk, 
      while higher levels of incorrect knowledge increased the degree of risk
      perceived. High levels of endorsement of the documented modes of HIV transmission
      do not necessarily indicate accurate or adequate knowledge about HIV transmission
      in the population. Co-occurring inaccurate beliefs about undocumented modes of
      transmission reflect cultural understandings of contagion and disease, and
      influence how individuals make sense of medical-scientific information about
      transmission. Our results suggest that the co-occurrence of correct and incorrect
      HIV transmission knowledge shapes individual-level risk perceptions. Given the
      independence of accurate knowledge and inaccurate beliefs. HIV/AIDS education and
      prevention programs must seek to directly undermine inaccurate beliefs about HIV 
      transmission as part of their efforts to promote behavior change.

TI  - Desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children.
PG  - CD002112
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful
      condition which affects around 15-20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young
      adults. Although there is a high rate of spontaneous remission, the social,
      emotional and psychological costs to the children can be great. OBJECTIVES: To
      assess the effects of desmopressin on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to
      compare desmopressin with other interventions. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following
      electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE to June 1997; AMED; ASSIA; BIDS;
      BIOSIS Previews (1985-1996); CINAHL; DHSS Data; EMBASE (1974 to June 1997);
      PsycLIT and SIGLE. Organisations, manufacturers, researchers and health
      professionals concerned with enuresis were contacted for information. The
      reference sections of obtained studies were also checked for further trials. Date
      of the most recent search: July 1997. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials
      of desmopressin for nocturnal enuresis in children were included in the review.
      Trials were eligible for inclusion if: children were randomised to receive
      desmopressin compared with placebo, other drugs or other conservative
      interventions for nocturnal bedwetting; participants with organic causes for
      their bedwetting were excluded; and baseline assessments of the level of
      bedwetting were reported. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting were excluded.
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of
      the eligible trials, and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty one randomised
      trials involving 948 children treated with desmopressin, met the inclusion
      criteria. The quality of many of the trials was poor. Desmopressin was compared
      with a tricyclic drug in two trials, and with alarms in one. Desmopressin was
      effective in reducing bedwetting in a variety of doses and forms. Each dose of
      desmopressin reduced bedwetting by at least one night per week during treatment
      (eg 20microg: 1.56 fewer wet nights per week, 95% CI -1.94 to -1.19).
      Participants on desmopressin were 4.6 times more likely to achieve 14 consecutive
      dry nights (95% CI 1.38 to 15.02) compared with placebo. However, there was no
      difference after treatment was finished. There was no apparent dose-related
      effect of desmopressin, but the evidence was limited. Data which compared oral
      and nasal administration were too few to be conclusive. Desmopressin and
      imipramine (a tricyclic drug) were equally effective in one small trial.
      Amitriptyline (another tricyclic) was not consistently better than desmopressin
      either alone or when used as a supplement. In a single trial, desmopressin was
      initially superior to using an alarm in reducing the number of wet nights per
      week: WMD -1.7 (95% CI: -2.96 to -0.45), but this result was not sustained; after
      three months of treatment, patients using the alarm had 1.4 fewer wet nights per 
      week than with desmopressin: (95% CI: 0.14 to 2.65). Participants receiving the
      alarm intervention were also nine times less likely to relapse than those given
      desmopressin: RR 9.2 (95% CI: 1.28 to 65.9). Combining alarm and drug therapy was
      found to be superior to alarm treatment alone. The addition of desmopressin to an
      alarm schedule resulted in one less wet night per week: (95% CI: -1.55 to -0.45).
      REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Desmopressin rapidly reduced the number of wet nights per
      week, but there was some evidence that this was not sustained after treatment
      stopped. Comparison with alternative treatments suggested that desmopressin and
      tricyclics had similar clinical effects, but that alarms produced more sustained 
      benefits. However, based on the available evidence, these conclusions can only be
      tentative. There was some evidence of minor side effects of desmopressin in the
      included trials, such as nasal irritation and nose bleeds. However, the risk of
      water intoxication associated with over-drinking before bedtime has been
      reported. Patients and their families need to be warned of potential adverse
      effects and advise

TI  - Cardiovascular effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 969-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The psychoactive stimulant 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA),
      also known as "ecstasy," is widely used in nonmedical settings. Little is known
      about its cardiovascular effects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute cardiovascular
      effects of MDMA by using transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler
      echocardiography. DESIGN: Four-session, ascending-dose, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Urban hospital. PATIENTS: Eight healthy adults
      who self-reported MDMA use. INTERVENTION: Echocardiographic effects of dobutamine
      (5, 20, and 40 microg/kg of body weight per minute) were measured in a
      preliminary session. Oral MDMA (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo was 
      administered 1 hour before echocardiographic measurements in three weekly
      sessions. MEASUREMENTS: Heart rate and blood pressure were measured at regular
      intervals before and after MDMA administration. Echocardiographic measures of
      stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and meridional wall stress were
      obtained 1 hour after MDMA administration and during dobutamine infusions.
      RESULTS: At a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, MDMA increased mean heart rate (by 28
      beats/min), systolic blood pressure (by 25 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (by 7
      mm Hg), and cardiac output (by 2 L/min). The effects of MDMA were similar to
      those of dobutamine, 20 and 40 microg/kg per minute. Inotropism, measured by
      using meridional wall stress corrected for ejection fraction, decreased after
      administration of dobutamine, 40 microg/kg per minute, but did not change after
      either dose of MDMA. CONCLUSIONS: Modest oral doses of MDMA increase heart rate, 
      blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption in a magnitude similar to
      dobutamine, 20 to 40 microg/kg per minute. In contrast to dobutamine, MDMA has no
      measurable inotropic effects.

TI  - Local infusion of heparin reduces anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia in
      aortoiliac expanded polytetrafluoroethylene bypass grafts in baboons.
PG  - 354-63
AB  - PURPOSE: Recently, we designed and characterized a novel expanded
      polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-based local drug delivery approach that
      selectively concentrates infused pharmacologic agents specifically within those
      blood layers adjacent to the graft wall and at downstream anastomotic sites. In
      this study, we locally administrated standard heparin therapy and evaluated its
      effects on neointimal hyperplasia formation in a baboon model of aortoiliac
      bypass graft placement. METHODS: Six adult male baboons underwent bilateral
      aortoiliac bypass grafting with ringed ePTFE (4 mm internal diameter x 5 cm
      length). In each animal, the distal anastomosis of one graft was continuously
      infused with heparin (50 U/h) and the distal anastomosis of the contralateral
      graft was infused with saline solution at the same rate (2.5 microL/h), with
      osmotic pumps implanted for 4 weeks. Platelet counts and activated partial
      thromboplastin time measurements were performed weekly. The specimens were
      harvested at 4 weeks and were subjected to morphometric analysis. Cell
      proliferation was assessed with bromodeoxyuridine immunostaining. RESULTS: All
      the harvested grafts were patent except for one control graft. There were no
      significant differences in platelet counts or activated partial thromboplastin
      time measurements taken before and during heparin infusion. As expected, there
      were no significant differences in graft neointimal hyperplasia and cell
      proliferation at the proximal anastomoses between the heparin-infused and control
      grafts. In contrast, at the treated distal anastomoses, heparin infusion
      significantly reduced the graft neointimal area by 65% and the cell proliferation
      index by 47% as compared with the untreated control distal anastomoses.
      CONCLUSION: These results show that local infusion of heparin significantly
      reduces distal anastomotic neointimal hyperplasia and cell proliferation without 
      measurable systemic anticoagulation or other side effects. Thus, this approach
      may represent an attractive strategy for prolonging ePTFE bypass graft patency.

TI  - Alveolar hemorrhage in systemic lupus erythematosus: presentation and management.
PG  - 1083-90
AB  - AIM: To describe our experience with alveolar hemorrhage (AH) in systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Review of medical records and pertinent medical
      literature using MEDLINE and reference lists from retrieved publications.
      PATIENTS: Seven patients with SLE admitted with episodes of AH (n = 11). RESULTS:
      Six patients were female, and one was male. Mean age at the time of AH was 31.1
      years. Mean duration of SLE was 4.5 years. AH occurred within 3 weeks of SLE
      onset in two patients. Recurrent AH was observed in four patients. Six patients
      were already receiving treatment for SLE at the time of AH. All patients
      presented with dyspnea and new pulmonary infiltrates. Hemoptysis occurred in only
      54%. All patients had BAL within 48 h of presentation. Temperature > or =39
      degrees C (102.2 degrees F) accompanied 82% of episodes. Glomerulonephritis was
      the most common nonpulmonary SLE manifestation (74%). Treatment with empiric IV
      antibiotics was initiated in 10 episodes. Initial treatment included high-dose
      corticosteroids (prednisone, 1 to 3 mg/kg/d [n = 2]; or IV methylprednisolone, 1 
      g/d [n = 9], with or without oral cyclophosphamide, 2 to 3 mg/kg/d [n = 7]).
      Plasmapheresis (three to four sessions) was added in five episodes for persistent
      AH. All patients survived. CONCLUSIONS: AH may mimic pneumonia. Hemoptysis may
      not be evident. Infection must be aggressively excluded, especially since many
      patients with AH are already receiving immunosuppressive therapy. AH frequently
      recurs despite ongoing immunosuppression. Although high mortality rates have been
      reported with AH in SLE, we observed 100% survival.

TI  - Rapid activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 and target gene expression in postischemic
      rat intestine.
PG  - 525-34
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The molecular mechanisms underlying intestinal mucosal
      damage-repair processes induced by ischemia-reperfusion (IR) remain unknown. We
      determined nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1)
      activities and the expression of potential target genes relevant to damage-repair
      events. METHODS: Rat jejunal segment was subjected to ischemia for 30 minutes
      followed by reperfusion for defined times. NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities; mucosal
      p105, p50, and inhibitor kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) levels; and c-fos,
      neurotensin, and ferritin H expression were determined by electrophoretic
      mobility shift assay and Western and Northern analyses, respectively. RESULTS:
      NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities were significantly elevated from 1 to 12 hours
      after reperfusion. The activated NF-kappaB in the nuclear extract consisted of
      solely p50 homodimers. Activation of p50 was associated with a decrease of p105, 
      generation of p50, and increased phosphorylation and degradation of
      IkappaB-alpha. The activated AP-1 contained c-fos but not c-jun, fosB, and Fra-1.
      Reperfusion induced a transient elevation of c-fos, prolonged increase of
      neurotensin, and early reduction followed by recovery of ferritin H messenger
      RNA. CONCLUSIONS: The intestine shows organ-specific responses to IR,
      characterized by prolonged NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation involving NF-kappaB p50 
      dimers and excluding AP-1 c-jun protein. Degradation of the IkappaB-gamma
      component of p105 and partial reduction IkappaB-alpha selectively activate
      p50/p50 dimers. Temporal patterns of target gene expression reflect functional
      relevance to mucosal damage-repair processes after IR.

TI  - Acid-induced esophageal shortening in humans: a cause of hiatus hernia?
PG  - 847-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hiatus hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease commonly coexist,
      and there is pathophysiological evidence that the presence of a hiatus hernia
      contributes to abnormal acid reflux. However, the cause of hiatus hernia remains 
      unclear. In an animal model, it has been shown that acute acid injury to the
      esophagus results in esophageal shortening, raising the possibility that reflux
      esophagitis per se can contribute to the formation of hiatus hernia by inducing
      esophageal shortening. AIM: To determine whether luminal acid produces esophageal
      shortening in humans. METHODS: Twelve volunteers were each studied on two
      occasions, one week apart, in a double-blind, crossover trial. The location of
      the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), as well as the LES resting pressure and
      axial length were determined at baseline and then again after 20 min of either
      acid or saline perfusion. RESULTS: Acid perfusion did not induce significant
      changes in resting LES pressure but resulted in proximal migration of the LES
      (ie, esophageal shortening) by an average of 0.5 cm, with the largest proximal
      migration being 1.8 cm. In contrast, saline perfusion resulted in slight distal
      migration of the LES (ie, esophageal lengthening). CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal acid
      perfusion causes longitudinal axis shortening of the esophagus and suggests that 
      gastroesophageal acid reflux may contribute to the cause of hiatus hernia.

TI  - Assessment of aortic valve stenosis severity: A new index based on the energy
      loss concept.
PG  - 765-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluid energy loss across stenotic aortic valves is influenced by
      factors other than the valve effective orifice area (EOA). We propose a new index
      that will provide a more accurate estimate of this energy loss. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: An experimental model was designed to measure EOA and energy loss in 2
      fixed stenoses and 7 bioprosthetic valves for different flow rates and 2
      different aortic sizes (25 and 38 mm). The results showed that the relationship
      between EOA and energy loss is influenced by both flow rate and aortic
      cross-sectional area (A(A)) and that the energy loss is systematically higher
      (15+/-2%) in the large aorta. The coefficient (EOAxA(A))/(A(A)-EOA) accurately
      predicted the energy loss in all situations (r(2)=0.98). This coefficient is more
      closely related to the increase in left ventricular workload than EOA. To account
      for varying flow rates, the coefficient was indexed for body surface area in a
      retrospective study of 138 patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis. The 
      energy loss index measured by Doppler echocardiography was superior to the EOA in
      predicting the end points, which were defined as death or aortic valve
      replacement. An energy loss index </=0.52 cm(2)/m(2) was the best predictor of
      adverse outcomes (positive predictive value of 67%). CONCLUSIONS: This new energy
      loss index has the potential to reflect the severity of aortic stenosis better
      than EOA. Further prospective studies are necessary to establish the relevance of
      this index in terms of clinical outcomes.

TI  - Capitolunate arthrodesis with scaphoid and triquetrum excision.
PG  - 824-32
AB  - A retrospective two-center outcome study was designed to evaluate the results of 
      capitolunate arthrodesis with scaphoid and triquetrum excision mainly for
      scapholunate advanced collapse patterns of arthritis. Fourteen wrists in 14
      patients were evaluated objectively by standard parameters and subjectively by
      the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment at an average of 28 months after 
      surgery (range, 14-51 months). All patients were men between the ages of 20 and
      70 years (average, 49 years). Two patients had a painful nonunion and one had
      persistent pain despite conversion to a solid wrist arthrodesis. One patient had 
      x-ray evidence of progressive radiolunate narrowing, but only occasional pain.
      Postoperative wrist flexion-extension arc was 53 degrees and radioulnar deviation
      arc was 18 degrees. Grip and pinch strengths were 71% and 75%, respectively, of
      the normal contralateral wrist. The results of our study indicate that
      capitolunate arthrodesis with scaphoid and triquetrum excision is comparable to
      other motion-preserving operative procedures for scapholunate advance collapse.

TI  - Phase I trial of the anti-Lewis Y drug immunoconjugate BR96-doxorubicin in
      patients with lewis Y-expressing epithelial tumors.
PG  - 2282-92
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a phase I clinical trial of BR96-Doxorubicin (BR96-Dox), a 
      chimeric anti-Lewis Y (Le(Y)) monoclonal antibody conjugated to doxorubicin, in
      patients whose tumors expressed the Le(Y) antigen. The study aimed to determine
      the toxicity, maximum-tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of
      BR96-Dox. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a phase I dose escalation study.
      BR96-Dox was initially administered alone as a 2-hour infusion every 3 weeks. The
      occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity necessitated the administration of
      BR96-Dox as a continuous infusion over 24 hours and use of antiemetics and
      antigastritis premedication. Patients experiencing severe GI toxicity underwent
      GI endoscopy. All patients underwent restaging after two cycles. RESULTS: A total
      of 66 patients predominantly with metastatic colon and breast cancer were
      enrolled onto the study. The most common side effects were GI toxicity, fever,
      and elevation of pancreatic lipase. At higher doses, BR96-Dox was associated with
      nausea, vomiting, and endoscopically documented exudative gastritis of the upper 
      GI tract, which was dose-limiting at a maximum dose of 875 mg/m(2) (doxorubicin
      equivalent, 25 mg/m(2)) administered every 3 weeks. Toxicity was reversible and
      generally of short duration. Premedication with the antiemetic Kytril
      (granisetron hydrochloride; SmithKline Beecham, Philadelphia, PA), the antacid
      omeprazole, and dexamethasone was most effective in ameliorating GI toxicity. A
      dose of 700 mg/m(2) BR96-Dox (doxorubicin equivalent, 19 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks
      was determined to be the optimal phase II dose when administered with antiemetic 
      and antigastritis prophylaxis. BR96-Dox deposition on tumor tissue was documented
      immunohistochemically and by confocal microscopy. At the 550-mg/m(2) dose, the
      half-life (mean +/- SD) of BR96 and doxorubicin was 300 +/- 95 hours and 43 +/- 4
      hours, respectively. BR96-Dox elicited a weak immune response in 37% of patients.
      Objective clinical responses were seen in two patients. CONCLUSION: BR96-Dox
      provides a unique strategy to deliver doxorubicin to Le(Y)-expressing tumor and
      was well tolerated at doses of 700 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. BR96-Dox was not
      associated with the typical side-effect profile of native doxorubicin and can
      potentially deliver high doses of doxorubicin to antigen-expressing tumors. A
      phase II study in doxorubicin-sensitive tumors is warranted.

TI  - Characteristics of ectopic discharges in a rat neuropathic pain model.
PG  - 253-61
AB  - Injured afferent neurons produce spontaneous activity that is generated away from
      the normal impulse generation site. Since this activity, referred to as ectopic
      discharges, may play a significant role in neuropathic pain, it is important to
      systematically analyze the activity in various pain states. The present study
      used the segmental spinal nerve injury model of neuropathic pain to quantify the 
      ectopic discharges from injured afferents in the neuropathic rat under various
      conditions. All aspects of measured ectopic discharges declined as postoperative 
      time lengthened. Neuropathic pain behaviors declined in a similar fashion over
      the same time period. Surgical sympathectomy on neuropathic animals lowered the
      level of ectopic discharges along with neuropathic pain behaviors. The data
      indicate that the level of ectopic discharges is well correlated with that of
      pain behaviors in a rat neuropathic pain model, and this reinforces the
      supposition that ectopic discharges are important to the maintenance of
      neuropathic pain behaviors. The data suggest that there are two components of
      ectopic discharge generator mechanisms: sympathetically dependent and
      sympathetically independent components.

TI  - Prediction of maternal and fetal complications in preeclampsia.
PG  - 19-23
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk for maternal and 
      fetal morbidity. The aim of this study was to identify factors predicting for
      maternal or fetal complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and eleven
      patients with preeclampsia were included. Endpoint variables were maternal and
      fetal complications. Any of the diagnosis eclampsia, hemolysis elevated liver low
      platelet (HELLP) syndrome, oliguria or placental abruption was considered a
      maternal complication. Fetal complications were: small for gestational age (SGA) 
      infant, umbilical artery pH<7.10 and admittance of the infant to a neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU). Independent variables were maternal age, parity,
      gestational age, renal function, platelet count, liver enzymes and blood
      pressure. Logistic regression analysis was used for statistical evaluation.
      RESULTS: The following independent significant predictors were identified:
      Maternal complication (n=10) was predicted only by diastolic blood pressure; odds
      ratio (OR) 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.25). SGA (n=21) was associated
      with maternal prepregnancy weight, OR 0.94 (0.89-0.99) and gestational age at
      debut of preeclampsia, OR 0.97 (0.94-0.99). NICU admittance (n=31) was only
      predicted by gestational age at delivery, OR 0.80 (0.67-0.96). No association was
      found between any of the independent variables and a low umbilical artery pH (n= 
      10). CONCLUSIONS: In the surveillance of patients with established preeclampsia, 
      the value of serial blood and urine sampling, which is common practice in many
      obstetrical units, might be questioned.

TI  - Medication adherence in psychosis: predictors and impact on outcome. A 2-year
      follow-up of first-admitted subjects.
PG  - 203-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the baseline characteristics predicting poor medication
      adherence following a first admission for psychosis, and the impact of poor
      medication adherence on outcome. METHOD: First-admitted subjects with psychosis
      (n = 65) were assessed at 6-month intervals over a 2-year follow-up. Medication
      adherence was assessed using multiple sources of information. RESULTS: Baseline
      lower occupational status, alcohol misuse and the intensity of delusional
      symptoms and suspiciousness predicted poor medication adherence during the 2-year
      follow-up. Over this period, subjects with poor medication adherence presented
      more frequently with an episodic course of illness and were more frequently
      readmitted, especially with regard to involuntary readmission. CONCLUSION: In
      naturalistic conditions one out of two subjects with psychosis interrupts his/her
      treatment in the months following his/her first discharge from hospital.
      Therapeutic programmes aimed at improving medication adherence should be
      implemented early in the course of psychosis to reduce the deleterious
      consequences of poor medication adherence on clinical outcome.

TI  - Fetal erythropoietin levels in pregnancies complicated by meconium passage: does 
      meconium suggest fetal hypoxia?
PG  - 188-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether umbilical cord plasma erythropoietin
      levels were different in deliveries complicated by meconium passage and to
      determine whether this response is influenced by gestational age. STUDY DESIGN:
      Fetal erythropoietin levels were measured in 203 appropriately grown neonates at 
      37 to 43 weeks of gestation; among those, 70 had passed meconium. RESULTS:
      Meconium passage in the entire population was associated with elevated fetal
      erythropoietin levels (68 vs 31 mIU/mL; P <.001). Cord blood gases, pH, base
      deficit, and PO (2), as well as the 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, were not
      different between the meconium and no-meconium groups. Gestational age and birth 
      weights were significantly higher in the meconium group. Stepwise multiple
      regression analysis with meconium and gestational age used as the independent
      variables showed both meconium and gestational age to be independently associated
      with fetal erythropoietin levels (r = 0.356, F = 14.5; meconium, P <.001;
      gestational age, P <.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that meconium
      passage can be associated with chronic fetal hypoxia as demonstrated by elevated 
      fetal erythropoietin levels, independent of gestational age.

TI  - Tolerance of uncertainty of medical students and practicing physicians.
PG  - 272-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tolerance of uncertainty is believed to be an important attribute of 
      practicing physicians. This study attempts to (1) estimate how medical students
      perceive physicians' tolerance of uncertainty and (2) measure the tolerance of
      uncertainty of practicing physicians. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING
      AND SUBJECTS: Medical students (n = 113) and practicing physicians (n = 151) at
      the Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University, Israel. MEASURES: A
      self-administered, Hebrew version of an instrument developed in the United
      States. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: Age, gender, seniority (year of study for students
      or years in practice for physicians), country of birth for students or of
      graduation for physicians, and physicians' specialty. DEPENDENT VARIABLES: Two
      dimensions, which were identified by factor analysis: reluctance to disclose
      uncertainty and stress from uncertainty. RESULTS: The estimates of physicians'
      stress from uncertainty by first-year students aged <22 years were higher than
      those by first-year students aged > or =22 years. There were no significant
      differences in the way junior and senior medical students perceived physicians'
      tolerance of uncertainty. Stress from uncertainty was higher in female physicians
      (P = 0.028) and in graduates of the former Soviet Union (P = 0.044) than among
      male physicians and Israeli graduates, respectively. Reluctance to disclose
      uncertainty was higher among graduates of the former Soviet Union (P = 0.003) and
      among psychiatrists (P = 0.021) than among Israeli graduates and other
      specialties, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability and factor structure of
      the instrument were replicated. The previously reported differences in tolerance 
      of uncertainty between women and men and between local and foreign graduates were
      confirmed. Physicians' tolerance of uncertainty appeared to be higher than that
      attributed to them by students. The expected age-related differences in
      perception of clinical uncertainty were not detected between junior and senior
      medical students.

TI  - Comparison of portal vein velocity and the hepatic venous pressure gradient in
      assessing the acute portal hemodynamic response to propranolol in patients with
      cirrhosis.
PG  - 2905-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study was to compare noninvasive Doppler
      sonography and invasive measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient
      (HVPG) to determine the acute portal hemodynamic response to propranolol in
      patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: In a blinded study design, portal vein
      velocity (PVV) and HVPG were simultaneously assessed in 11 cirrhotic patients for
      4 h after oral ingestion of 40 mg propranolol. RESULTS: Both HVPG (17.2% +/-
      4.3%, p < 0.0001) and PVV (15.6% +/- 2.1%, p < 0.0002) showed a highly
      significant reduction during the study period versus baseline. Based on HVPG
      measurements, four patients (36%) were classified as nonresponders. These
      patients had a significantly lower PVV reduction compared to the responders
      (responders: 18.8% +/- 2.0% vs nonresponders: 10.0% +/- 2.1%, p < 0.05).
      Nonresponders were identified by Doppler sonography with a sensitivity of 1.0,
      specificity of 0.86, and positive predictive value of 0.9 when a threshold of 20%
      PVV reduction 120 min after drug intake was applied. CONCLUSIONS: Doppler
      sonography is a useful tool for assessment of the acute portal hemodynamic effect
      of propranolol. To distinguish portal hemodynamic nonresponders from responders
      to propranolol, PVV measurements should be carried out 2 h after drug
      administration, and PVV reduction should be not <20% in propranolol responders.

TI  - Retinal disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 705-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of retinopathy in systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) and to clarify its significance in relation to other clinical
      manifestations. METHODS: A cross sectional study on lupus retinopathy was made in
      69 patients with SLE. One expert ophthalmologist examined the ocular fundi of the
      lupus patients without any information of their disease state. Clinical and
      laboratory findings in the patients with retinopathy and those without were
      compared. RESULTS: Retinopathy was found in 7/69 (10%) patients. The findings
      included haemorrhages, vasculitis, cotton wool spots, and hard exudates, all of
      which were considered to reflect vascular damage. Retinopathy was found to be
      associated with the presence of anticardiolipin antibody (p<0.05) and with
      central nervous system lupus (p<0.01). The patients with retinopathy had higher
      levels of serum creatinine than the patients without retinopathy (p<0.01). The
      disease activity of lupus, as assessed by the maximum SLE disease activity index 
      (SLEDAI) score of the patients, was also significantly higher in the patients
      with retinopathy (p<0.03). CONCLUSION: Incidence of retinopathy in SLE was
      similar to that in previous reports and it may reflect tissue microangiopathy,
      particularly associated with vasculitis or anticardiolipin antibodies, or both.

TI  - Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease causing thoracic cord
      compression: case report.
PG  - 222-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition
      disease is being increasingly recognized. Spinal involvement in CPPD deposition
      disease is rare. When involved, the cervical and lumbar regions are commonly
      affected. We report a rare case of CPPD deposition disease that caused thoracic
      cord compression. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old woman presented with
      clinical features suggestive of thoracic cord compression. Radiographic findings 
      were consistent with calcification of the ligamenta flava in the lower thoracic
      levels causing cord compression. Calcification of the ligamentum flavum is
      commonly attributed to CPPD deposition disease. Evaluation for conditions that
      might be associated with CPPD deposition disease proved to be negative.
      INTERVENTION: Laminectomy with removal of the calcified ligamenta flava was
      performed. Histopathological examination of the excised ligaments revealed
      evidence of CPPD crystals. Postoperatively, the patient's spasticity decreased
      and sensations improved, with no significant improvement in motor power.
      CONCLUSION: Calcification of the ligamenta flava due to CPPD deposition disease
      is a rare cause of thoracic cord compression. CPPD deposition disease should be
      entertained in the differential diagnosis of thoracic cord compression.

TI  - Strong decline in herpes simplex virus antibodies over time among young
      homosexual men is associated with changing sexual behavior.
PG  - 666-73
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the change in sexual behavior
      among homosexual men observed after the start of the acquired immunodeficiency
      syndrome epidemic resulted in a change in herpes simplex virus (HSV)
      seroprevalence in this group over time. In a cross-sectional study, the
      prevalence of herpesvirus types 1 (HSV1) and 2 (HSV2) was determined at study
      entry in 1984-1985 and 1995-1997 among 532 young (aged < or = 30 years)
      homosexual men participating in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS. Risk
      factors for the presence of HSV antibodies, including human immunodeficiency
      virus infection, were evaluated, and their influence on HSV prevalence over time 
      was assessed. A strong decrease in HSV1 and HSV2 seroprevalence, from 80.6% to
      59.0% and from 51.3% to 19.0%, respectively, was observed between the two time
      periods. This decrease was not markedly influenced by various demographic and
      socioeconomic factors. After data were controlled for several markers of sexual
      activity (such as number of sex partners, human immunodeficiency virus infection,
      and past episode(s) of gonorrhea), it appeared that the decline in HSV
      seroprevalence was explained by a concurrent decrease in the presence of these
      markers. The authors conclude that among young homosexual men in this study, the 
      strong decrease in HSV seroprevalence was associated with a concurrent shift in
      sexual behavior. Furthermore, these data suggest an increasing sexual component
      in HSV1 transmission over time.

TI  - Transcommissural valvuloplasty: technique and results.
PG  - 969-76
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the technique of a variation
      of closed external venous valve repair (transcommissural valvuloplasty), its
      complication rate, and duplex scan durability. METHODS: The "blind"
      transcommissural valve repair of the vein was performed by placing transluminal
      sutures along the valve attachment lines, which simultaneously closed the valve
      attachment angle and also tightened the valve cusps. A total of 179 successfully 
      repaired valve sites of 141 limbs in 129 patients were followed up 1 to 42 months
      through clinical observation and with duplex Doppler ultrasound scan. RESULTS:
      Postoperative complications (< 30 days) occurred in 12 (9%) of 141 limbs:
      superficial (1) and deep (1) wound infection, large wound hematoma (4), seroma
      (1), and deep vein thrombosis (5), with associated pulmonary embolus in one
      patient. Seventy-eight percent (reflux time </= 0.5 seconds) and 81% (reflux time
      </= 1.0 seconds) of valve sites were competent. The cumulative competency rate at
      30 months was 59% and 63%, respectively. The cumulative ulcer recurrence-free
      interval was 63% at 30 months (n = 92). The pain score and swelling grade
      substantially improved. CONCLUSION: Transcommissural valvuloplasty is a safe
      procedure with low morbidity. It is relatively rapid and simple to perform, and
      its competency rates are comparable to those of internal valvuloplasty.
      Advantages over the internal repair are that venotomy is not required, repair can
      be extended to small-caliber veins, and multiple valve stations can be repaired
      in a single stage.

      most widely used HRQL instrument for these patients. However, its use with
      patients in the United Kingdom has not been validated. This study develops and
      validates a UK version of the McMaster IBDQ (UK IBDQ). The UK IBDQ was tested
      with two samples of patients for its reliability, validity, reproducibility, and 
      responsiveness. The first sample consisted of 180 patients participating in a
      randomized clinical trial. The second was recruited from members of the National 
      Association for Colitis and Crohns Disease. Reliability of the subscales and the 
      summary score of the UK IBDQ is demonstrated by Cronbach's alpha and item-total
      correlations. Their validity is demonstrated by their correlations with SF-36
      subscales and an empirical index of disease activity. Good intraclass
      correlations and responsiveness ratios show their reproducibility and
      responsiveness. The findings support the reliability, validity, reproducibility, 
      and responsiveness of the UK IBDQ and its acceptability to patients in UK.

TI  - Medical significance of Caenorhabditis elegans.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is now the model organism of choice for a growing number
      of researchers. A combination of its apparent simplicity, exquisite genetics, the
      existence of a full molecular toolkit and a complete genome sequence makes it
      ideal for rapid and effective study of gene function. A survey of the C. elegans 
      genome indicates that this 'simple' worm contains many genes with a high degree
      of similarity to human disease genes. For many human disease genes it has proven,
      and will continue to prove, difficult to elucidate their function by direct
      study. In such cases simpler model organisms may prove to be a more productive
      starting point. The basic function of a human disease gene may be studied in the 
      background of C. elegans, in which the most important interactions are likely to 
      be conserved, providing an insight into disease process in humans. Here we
      consider the significance of this modality for human disease processes and
      discuss how C. elegans may, in some cases, be ideal in the study of the function 
      of human disease genes and act as a model for groups of parasitic nematodes that 
      have a severe impact on world health.

TI  - Photoangioplasty for human peripheral atherosclerosis: results of a phase I trial
      of photodynamic therapy with motexafin lutetium (Antrin).
PG  - 2322-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: In photoangioplasty, light activation of a photosensitive drug offers
      the potential for treatment of long segments of vascular disease. This is a brief
      description of a study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a new 
      photosensitizer, Antrin (motexafin lutetium), in the endovascular treatment of
      atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: An open-label, single-dose, escalating
      drug- and light-dose study was performed in patients with atherosclerotic
      peripheral arterial insufficiency. Clinical evaluation, serial quantitative
      angiography, and intravascular ultrasonography were performed. Therapy was well
      tolerated, and only minor side effects were observed. Treatment produced no
      deleterious vascular effects. Although this study was not designed to examine
      clinical efficacy, several secondary end points suggested a favorable therapeutic
      effect. CONCLUSIONS: This phase I study demonstrates that photoangioplasty with
      motexafin lutetium is well tolerated and safe. Preliminary efficacy data suggest 
      a future role for the treatment of flow-limiting atherosclerosis.

TI  - Empirical examination of current depression categories in a population-based
      study: symptoms, course, and risk factors.
PG  - 573-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research studies on the validity of current diagnostic and
      subthreshold categories of depression that use a population-based follow-up
      design are rare. The authors examined the validity and utility of four current
      depression categories by examining subject transition between categories and the 
      symptoms, course, and risk factors of each. METHOD: A general population sample
      of 1,920 adults from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area 13-year follow-up
      study were examined. Data on diagnoses, symptoms, course, and risk factors were
      collected by using the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview
      Schedule, the Life Chart Interview, and an office visit. Polychotomous regression
      was used to examine the heterogeneity of four diagnostic categories: major
      depressive disorder, depressive syndrome, dysthymia, and a comorbid depression
      condition (major depressive disorder and dysthymia). RESULTS: Transitions between
      the four depression categories occurred over the 13 years. Symptom profiles for
      the four categories were parallel but differed in severity. Course
      characteristics among the four categories slightly differed. Risk factor profiles
      showed significant differences. Family history was associated with both
      depressive syndrome and major depressive disorder. Stressful life events were
      most strongly associated with depressive syndrome. Female gender was most
      strongly associated with the comorbid depression category. CONCLUSIONS: The
      evidence suggests that except for dysthymia, the depression categories are
      genetically homogeneous and environmentally heterogeneous. Stress is associated
      with mild depression, and gender is associated with severe depression. The
      apparent familial transmission of the subthreshold entity, depressive syndrome,
      needs further investigation.

TI  - Suicide attempts and impulse control disorder are related to low cerebrospinal
      fluid 5-HIAA in mentally disordered violent offenders.
PG  - 395-402
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between low 
      cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (CSF 5-HIAA) and aggressive acts
      in mentally disordered violent offenders. METHOD: CSF concentrations of
      5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid and
      4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl glycol were measured in 35 drug-free men convicted of
      homicide and currently undergoing forensic psychiatric investigation in a high
      security hospital. RESULTS: The mean metabolite concentrations in the homicide
      offenders did not differ from those of age- and body-height matched male control 
      subjects. One-third of the murderers had made one or several suicide attempts,
      and their mean concentration of spinal fluid 5-HIAA was significantly lower than 
      that of the remaining murderers. Subjects with impulse control disorder also had 
      lower mean CSF 5-HIAA. A consistent pattern of higher CSF 5-HIAA in subjects with
      more self-reported anxiety traits was observed. CONCLUSION: The association
      between serotonin and suicidal behaviour holds for yet another subject group.
      Determining CSF 5-HIAA might be worth while in the routine assessment of
      psychiatrically ill homicide offenders.

TI  - Experiencing liver transplantation: a phenomenological approach.
PG  - 327-34
AB  - In order to promote health, nurses and other health care professionals need to
      discover and articulate the meaning that is implicit in experiencing life after
      liver transplantation. From such an understanding, appropriate nursing
      interventions can be based. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      subjective experiences of the meaning of having a liver transplant, 1 year after 
      the transplantation. After approval from the ethics committee at Goteborg
      University, 12 patients, nine women and three men, were interviewed. The study
      sample was chosen strategically to represent common diagnoses preceding liver
      transplantation. A phenomenological approach was chosen for the study. Analyses
      of the interviews were based on a modified version of a phenomenological method
      by Karlsson. Seven categories emerged: facing the inevitable; recapturing the
      body; emotional chaos; leaving the experts; family and friends; the threat of
      graft rejection; and honouring the donor. Having undergone a liver transplant
      meant living in a paradoxical situation. Knowing that you survived, it was a
      struggle to regain physical strength under great emotional stress. The recipients
      had to self-administer life-long medication, recognize symptoms indicating a
      potential problem and monitor for the possibility of graft rejection. Social
      support was essential for recovery. Meeting others with the same experience
      helped liver-transplanted patients to deal with their identity crises as well as 
      undergo a transformation from being utterly unique to a survivor among others.
      The clinical implications from this study are that interventions, such as patient
      education, and social and mental support, are important tools to optimize both
      self-care capacity and the ability to maintain a healthy perception of identity
      after having a liver transplant at least up to 12 months post-transplant.

TI  - Clinical relevance of sentinel lymph nodes outside the axilla in patients with
      breast cancer.
PG  - 920-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphatic mapping in patients with breast cancer can reveal sentinel 
      lymph nodes that are not located at level I-II of the axilla. Little is known
      about the clinical relevance of these nodes. METHODS: Some 113 consecutive
      patients with clinical stage T1-3 N0 M0 breast cancer were studied. Based on
      preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, sentinel node biopsy was performed guided by a
      gamma probe and patent blue dye. All sentinel nodes that were visible on
      lymphoscintigraphy were sought. Pathological examination of the sentinel nodes
      included step-sections and staining with CAM 5. 2. Axillary node dissection was
      performed regardless of sentinel lymph node status. RESULTS: Twenty-one (19 per
      cent) of 113 patients had sentinel lymph nodes outside level I-II of the axilla, 
      mostly in the internal mammary chain. Twenty-two of the 30 sentinel nodes at
      these sites were harvested. Three patients had sentinel nodes only outside the
      axilla. Four other patients had metastases outside the axilla. This changed
      postoperative treatment in three patients. No postoperative complication
      occurred. CONCLUSION: Sentinel lymph nodes outside level I-II of the axilla were 
      present in 19 per cent of patients with breast cancer in this series. Biopsy of
      these nodes was technically demanding but was performed without additional
      morbidity. The clinical impact was limited; treatment changed in only 3 per cent.
      Presented to the 52nd annual meeting of the Society of Surgical Oncology in
      Orlando, Florida, USA, March 1999 and the First International Congress on the
      Sentinel Node in Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer in Amsterdam, The Netherlands,
      April 1999, and published in abstract form as Eur J Nucl Med 1999; 26(Suppl): S71

TI  - Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the insertion sequence
      IS1381 in group B Streptococci.
PG  - 364-8
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) are typed by capsular polysaccharide type. IS1381, an 
      insertion sequence previously described in Streptococcus pneumoniae, was cloned
      from GBS strain A909. The presence of multiple copies of IS1381 in A909 suggested
      that IS1381 analysis might be an effective subtyping tool. IS1381 was found by
      Southern blot analysis to be present in 18 (72%) of 25 of unrelated GBS isolates 
      tested. IS1381 analysis allowed discrimination between strains that contain
      IS1381 with a discriminatory power >99%. Eight of 8 sets of epidemiologically
      related isolates containing IS1381 give identical or nearly identical patterns of
      IS1381 insertion. For 2 maternal/infant sets, a single additional insertion was
      seen in 1 strain, suggesting that an additional insertion occurred between
      maternal colonization and infection of the infant. Insertion patterns of IS1381
      are an effective tool for subtyping GBS.

TI  - A rapid-format antibody card test for diagnosis of onchocerciasis.
PG  - 1796-9
AB  - Improved methods are needed for field diagnosis of onchocerciasis, to support
      efforts aimed at elimination of the disease. A rapid-format card test was
      evaluated that detects IgG4 antibodies to recombinant Onchocerca volvulus antigen
      Ov16 with serum samples from patients with onchocerciasis and with various types 
      of control serum samples. The sensitivity of the test with serum samples from 106
      microfilariae-positive subjects was 90.6%. The test was equally sensitive with
      serum samples obtained from patients in Africa and Latin America. Specificity was
      excellent; positive tests were observed for 2 of 38 serum samples from patients
      with other filarial infections and for 1 of 23 serum samples from patients with
      nonfilarial helminth infections. The 3 "false-positive" serum samples were from
      West Africans who could have been coinfected with onchocerciasis. No positive
      tests were observed with nonendemic serum samples from normal adults, patients
      with autoimmune disorders, or patients with the hyper-IgE syndrome. This new test
      holds great promise as a simple tool for diagnosis of onchocerciasis.

TI  - Prostate carcinoma: production of bioactive factors.
PG  - 3002-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many molecular mechanisms regulate prostate carcinoma pathogenesis,
      proliferation, and progression to bone metastases. The basic molecular mechanisms
      are endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and intracrine. These mechanisms can be
      mediated by a variety of agents, including gonadal and adrenal steroids, retinoic
      acid and vitamin D derivatives, neuroendocrine factors, growth factors,
      cytokines, lymphokine, and bone factors. Prominent among them is parathyroid
      hormone-related protein (PTHrP). METHODS: The author studied the expression and
      regulation of PTHrP production in prostate carcinoma cells with nucleic acid and 
      immunochemical probes for the polypeptide. The robust expression of this
      oncoprotein by prostate carcinoma has been demonstrated. In the current study the
      author reviews his results and the studies of other investigators regarding PTHrP
      and the variety of bioactive factors produced by prostate cells. RESULTS: PTHrP
      is expressed by most prostate carcinoma. It also is expressed by normal and
      hyperplastic prostate cells, and there is a gradient of expression that peaks in 
      malignant prostate cells. PTHrP is processed by carcinoma cells into peptides
      that have unique biologic effects. Among them are regulation of growth and
      cytokine expression. It has been observed that the effect of PTHrP can be
      mediated by novel intracrine pathways in prostate carcinoma. These mechanisms
      influence transduction of growth regulatory signaling pathways, cell
      proliferation, immunoregulation, and angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The current study
      identified PTHrP among the bioactive prostate factors that appear to participate 
      in prostate carcinoma pathogenesis and progression. This oncofetal protein is
      commonly expressed by prostate carcinoma, and its regulatory interactions with
      other bioactive prostate cell products play an important role in the pathobiology
      of prostate carcinoma. Understanding these regulatory interactions among prostate
      carcinoma, its cell products, and the skeleton continues to provide insights into
      the pathogenesis of this disease entity and may provide clues to clinical
      management.

TI  - Improving the outcomes of carotid endarterectomy: results of a statewide quality 
      improvement project.
PG  - 918-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish the statewide outcomes for 
      carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and to facilitate improvement in outcomes through
      feedback, peer discussion, and ongoing process and outcome measurement. METHODS: 
      The Medicare Part A claims files were used to identify all Medicare patients
      undergoing CEA in Iowa during two 12-month time periods (January 1994-December
      1994 and June 1995-May 1996). Medical record abstraction was used to obtain
      surgical indications, perioperative care process, and outcome information.
      Confidential reports were provided to each hospital (N = 30) where the procedure 
      was performed. Surgeons performing the procedure (N = 79) were invited to
      meetings to discuss care process variation and outcomes. Voluntary participation 
      was solicited in a standardized program of ongoing hospital-based data collection
      of CEA process and outcome data. RESULTS: The statewide combined stroke or
      mortality rate decreased from 7.8% in 1994 to 4.0% in the 1995 to 1996 time
      period (P <.001). Fourteen hospitals, accounting for 74% of the statewide cases, 
      participated in ongoing data collection. The combined stroke or mortality rate in
      these hospitals decreased significantly (P <.05) over time from 6.5% (1994) to
      3.7% (1995-1996) to 1.8% (June 1997-May 1998). The use of intraoperative
      assessment of the operative site (20% in 1994, 46% in 1997-1998) and patch
      angioplasty (14% in 1994, 30% in 1997-1998) increased significantly during this
      time in the participating hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Confidential feedback of
      outcome and process data for CEA may lead to change in perioperative care
      processes and improved outcomes. Standardized community-based outcome analysis
      should become routine for CEA to ensure that optimum results are being achieved.

TI  - Radiation-induced temporal lobe changes: CT and MR imaging characteristics.
PG  - 431-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article documents the CT and MR imaging characteristics of
      patients with temporal lobe changes after radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. These characteristics may serve to differentiate radiation-induced
      changes from intracranial tumor recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed
      the imaging records of 1916 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma examined over 
      a 5-year period. Forty-seven patients (2.5%) had temporal lobe changes.
      Thirty-four patients underwent CT (55 examinations), and 26 patients underwent MR
      imaging (32 examinations). Thirteen patients underwent CT and MR imaging. These
      studies were independently analyzed according to imaging technique and were
      categorized as follows: location of lesions, characteristics of gray or white
      matter changes, and patterns of late changes. RESULTS: On CT, 12 patients (35%)
      had unilateral temporal lobe changes, and 22 patients (65%) had bilateral
      temporal lobe changes. The following patterns were noted: ill-defined contrast
      enhancement in 27 patients (79%); solid enhancement in six patients (18%); and
      ring enhancement in one patient (3%). On MR imaging, 11 patients (42%) had
      unilateral lesions, and 15 patients (58%) had bilateral lesions. Simultaneous
      gray and white matter lesions were noted in 17 patients (65%), and nine patients 
      (35%) had lesions localized to the gray matter. Three patients (6%) had cerebral 
      atrophy, and two patients (4%) had encephalomalacia. CONCLUSION: The temporal
      lobes show characteristic CT and MR imaging features after radiation injury.
      Familiarity with these changes may assist in differentiating temporal lobe
      changes from progressive nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

TI  - Giving bad news: the family perspective.
PG  - 865-70; discussion 870-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Death from trauma frequently comes without forewarning. Relating the 
      news of death to the family is often the responsibility of trauma surgeons. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate the key characteristics and methods of
      delivering bad news from the perspective of surviving family members. METHODS: We
      designed and administered a survey tool to surviving family members of trauma
      patients dying in the emergency department or intensive care unit. The tool
      consisted of 14 elements that surviving family members graded in importance when 
      receiving bad news (1, least; 6, most). Respondents also judged the attention
      given to these elements (good, fair, or poor) by the person giving the bad news
      of death. RESULTS: Fifty-four family members of 48 patients who died completed
      the survey (44 intensive care unit deaths, 4 emergency room deaths). Deceased
      patients ranged in age from 12 to 91 years (mean, 53 years). Death occurred
      within 2 days of injury in 69% of the patients and within 1 week in 83%. The most
      important features of delivering bad news were judged to be attitude of the
      news-giver (ranked most important by 72%), clarity of the message (70%), privacy 
      (65%), and knowledge/ ability to answer questions (57%). The attire of the
      news-giver ranked as least important (3%). Sympathy, time for questions, and
      location of the conversation were ranked of intermediate importance. Touching was
      unwanted by 30% of the respondents, but encouraged or acceptable in 24%.
      CONCLUSION: The attitude of the news-giver, combined with clarity of the message 
      and the time, privacy, and knowledge to answer questions are the most important
      aspects of giving bad news. This information should be incorporated into resident
      training.

TI  - Opioid antagonists for alcohol dependence.
PG  - CD001867
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, disulfiram, 
      and lithium have not been clear for people with alcohol dependence. While the
      results of many studies have suggested that opioid agonists increase alcohol
      consumption, others have shown that mu-opioid antagonists and partial agonists
      reduce alcohol consumption. The results from animal studies suggest that these
      agents may prevent the reinforcing effects of alcohol consumption. Based on the
      results of those animal studies, some opioid antagonists, such as, naltrexone,
      nalmefene, have been studied for their benefits in treating alcohol dependence.
      OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of opioid antagonists in attenuating
      or preventing the recommencement of alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol 
      dependence in comparison to placebo, other medications and psychosocial
      treatments. In addition, discontinuation rate, death, patient satisfaction,
      functioning, health-related quality of life and economic outcomes were also
      evaluated. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and
      Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were undertaken. Du Pont Pharmaceutical and
      Ivax Corporation were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials. The
      reference lists of the obtained papers were also examined. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical control trials
      (CCTs) were included. Participants were people with alcohol dependence, diagnosed
      by any set of criteria, except alcohol dependence who were currently abstinent.
      Naltrexone (NTX), nalmefene (NMF) and other opioid antagonists with/without other
      biological or psychosocial treatments were examined. A variety of clinical
      outcomes, for example alcohol consumption, duration of abstinence, were
      considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers evaluated and extracted
      the data independently. The dichotomous data were extracted on an
      intention-to-treat basis in which the dropouts were assigned as participants with
      the worst outcomes. The Peto Odds Ratio with the 95% confidence interval was used
      to assess the dichotomous data. Weighted Mean Difference with 95% confidence
      interval was used to assess the continuous data. MAIN RESULTS: The short-term (< 
      3 months) benefits of NTX were shown in three respects, which were number of
      patients who return to drinking, percentage or number of drinking days and the
      number of standard drinks of alcohol. However, 6 months after the completion of
      12-week NTX treatment, the benefit of decreasing the number of patients who
      return to drinking were lost. The short-term evidence from a small sample-size
      study suggested that disulfiram was more effective than NTX in the respects of
      number of abstinent days, percentage or number of drinking days and number of
      standard drinks of alcohol. The evidence from another small sample-size study
      also suggested that NTX plus an aversive agent was superior to an aversive agent 
      alone in the respect of number of patients who return to drinking in short-,
      medium-, and long-term treatment. From two short-term and small sample-size
      studies, the benefit of NMF was shown only in the respect of number of patients
      who return to drinking. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Due to the limited evidence, the 
      following conclusions should be viewed as tentative. NTX has some benefits for
      patients with alcohol dependence, but patients' adherence to treatment should be 
      of concern. Psychosocial treatments should be concurrently given with NTX. The
      optimal duration of NTX treatment is not yet known. Although NTX is available for
      treating alcohol dependence in many countries, in the respect of
      cost-effectiveness, disulfiram should still remain as an alternative. Due to the 
      dearth of evidence, at present, the combination of NTX and disulfiram or NMF
      alone should not be used in everyday clinical practice. Randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trials of NTX treatment in patients with alcohol dependence

TI  - Lynch syndrome: genetics, natural history, genetic counseling, and prevention.
PG  - 19S-31S
AB  - Lynch syndrome is the most common hereditary form of colorectal cancer (CRC). Its
      natural history has been investigated extensively, so that highly targeted
      surveillance and management strategies, melded to its natural history, have
      proven effective in cancer control. Most important is the early age of onset of
      cancer (approximately 44 years), involving CRC and the several extracolonic
      cancers that are integral to the syndrome. With respect to CRC, approximately 70%
      of cases occur proximal to the splenic flexure. Synchronous and metachronous CRCs
      are extremely common. Full colonoscopy should be initiated when the patient is
      between the ages of 20 and 25, and because of the accelerated carcinogenesis of
      CRC, it should be performed every 1 to 2 years. The presence of initial CRC
      requires subtotal colectomy, given the mentioned increased frequency of
      metachronous cancer. Options available for germ-line mutation carriers, in
      addition to cancer screening, include prophylactic colectomy as well as
      prophylactic total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
      The discovery of mismatch repair germ-line mutations (most commonly MSH2 or MLH1)
      has added significantly to the recognition of this disease as well as to the
      search for high-risk individuals throughout families who, with genetic
      counseling, may become candidates for germ-line mutation testing. Clearly,
      hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer provides an excellent opportunity for
      learning about the etio-pathogenesis of cancer at the molecular and clinical
      levels and how this knowledge might ultimately be exploited for cancer control. A
      search for chemoprevention agents, such as cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors, as well 
      as for putative environmental effects and how they may interact with the genetic 
      component in CRC etiology should abet this entire cancer control process.

TI  - Vasovagal syncope.
PG  - 714-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vasovagal syncope is the most common type of syncope and is one of
      the most difficult types to manage. PURPOSE: This article reviews the status of
      mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of vasovagal syncope. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE
      search for English-language and German-language articles on vasovagal syncope
      published up to June 1999. STUDY SELECTION: Case reports and series, clinical
      trials, research investigations, and review articles from peer-reviewed journals.
      DATA EXTRACTION: Findings were summarized and discussed individually. Summaries
      were made in table format. Statistical analysis of combined data was
      inappropriate because of differences among studies in patient selection, testing,
      and follow-up. DATA SYNTHESIS: The population of patients with vasovagal syncope 
      is highly heterogeneous. Triggers of vasovagal syncope are likely to be protean, 
      and many potential central and peripheral triggers have been identified. The
      specific mechanisms underlying the interactions among decreased preload,
      sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation, vasodilation, and cardioinhibition
      remain unknown. Tilt-table testing is a widely used diagnostic tool. The test
      results should be interpreted in the context of patients' clinical presentations 
      and with an understanding of the sensitivity and specificity of the test.
      Assessment of therapeutic outcomes has been difficult, primarily because of
      patient heterogeneity, the large number of pharmacologic agents available for
      therapy, and the sporadic nature of the syndrome complex. CONCLUSIONS: Vasovagal 
      syncope is a common clinical syndrome that has complex and variable mechanisms
      and is difficult to manage. Advancements are being made in laboratory
      investigations of its triggering mechanisms. Randomized, controlled trials of
      pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are needed. Mechanism-targeted
      therapeutic trials may improve clinical outcomes.

TI  - Medicine, psychiatry and euthanasia: an argument against mandatory psychiatric
      review.
PG  - 318-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The paper critically appraises the argument that requests for active
      assistance to die should be subject to mandatory psychiatric assessment. METHOD: 
      The argument for mandatory psychiatric assessment is usually supported by an
      appeal to the need for safeguards against errors and omissions in both the
      diagnosis of psychiatric conditions affecting the terminally ill and the
      exploration of the meanings of their requests. This intuitively appealing view is
      challenged through a broader analysis which examines connections between
      medicine's traditional adherence to the moral distinction between acts and
      omissions and the following issues: the historical relationship between medical
      practice and dying, the recent development of research into treatment-withdrawal 
      decisions, the scientific status of psychiatry, the logic of rationality and
      decision-making competence. RESULTS: The analysis reveals a number of hitherto
      unexamined and unacknowledged influences which would make psychiatric review of
      requests for assisted death a much less objective and impartial process than is
      assumed. CONCLUSION: Mandatory psychiatric review is an instance of the
      medicalisation of death and dying which could abridge the freedom of certain
      individuals to make decisions about their deaths.

TI  - Magnesium sulfate protection of fetal rat brain from severe maternal hypoxia.
PG  - 124-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether severe maternal hypoxia affects fetal rat
      physical characteristics and causes neuronal damage, and whether magnesium
      sulfate can decrease these effects. METHODS: At 17 days gestation, rats were
      randomly assigned to one of four groups that received saline injections and room 
      air (n = 6), magnesium sulfate and room air (n = 5), saline and hypoxia (n = 5)
      or magnesium sulfate and hypoxia (n =5). Maternal magnesium sulfate or saline
      injections were given for 4 hours. In groups 3 and 4 this was followed by a
      hypoxia chamber protocol that included a gas mixture of 9% oxygen and 3% carbon
      dioxide for 2 hours. After 72 hours of recovery, fetuses were delivered
      abdominally, perfused transcardially, and brains removed intact. Fetal body and
      brain weight and size were measured. Brains were embedded in paraffin, sectioned,
      and stained. A neuropathologist masked to the protocol performed histologic
      grading of brain regions. RESULTS: Exposure to the hypoxia chamber resulted in
      decreased maternal oxygen tension and pH (from 82.8 +/- 20.0 to 49.2 +/- 14.4
      mmHg, and from 7.37 +/- 0.05 to 7.20 +/- 0.04, respectively; P <.005). Magnesium 
      sulfate administration resulted in higher magnesium levels in blood (from 1. 52
      +/- 0.2 to 3.77 +/- 0.7 mg/dL; P <.001). The hypoxia protocol resulted in a
      significant decrease in fetal body and brain size, but not weight. Hypoxia also
      caused an increase in the proportion of fetal rats that had brain injury,
      including shrinkage of cells and karyorrhexis in the hippocampus and thalamus
      (from 0% to 38.1% and 38.9%, respectively; P <.05). Magnesium sulfate reduced
      these effects on fetal brain histopathology and size. CONCLUSION: Severe maternal
      rat hypoxia resulted in significant fetal neuronal damage and decreased fetal
      body and brain size. Maternal magnesium sulfate administration reduced the effect
      of hypoxia on fetal brain histopathology and size without affecting body size.

TI  - Aneurysmal bone cyst of the first cervical vertebrae in a child treated with
      percutaneous intralesional injection of calcitonin and methylprednisolone. A case
      report.
PG  - 527-30; discussion 531
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: First published report of a child with an aneurysmal bone cyst
      (ABC) of the first cervical vertebrae treated successfully with intralesional
      injection of calcitonin and methylprednisolone. OBJECTIVES: To describe a safe
      and effective nonsurgical treatment method for an ABC of the first cervical
      vertebrae. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Aneurysmal bone cysts of the spine
      comprise from 3% to 20% of all such lesions. Upper cervical spine involvement is 
      rare and these lesions are difficult to treat. Standard treatment with curettage 
      and bone grafting or other alternatives such as radiation therapy or embolization
      may not be possible in this location. Percutaneous injection with a variety of
      agents has also been described. Methylprednisolone and calcitonin were selected
      in this case in an effort to combine the proposed angiostatic and fibroblastic
      inhibitory effects of steroid with the proposed osteoclastic inhibitory and
      promotion of new bony trabeculae formation effects of calcitonin. METHOD: This
      case was described, and pertinent literature reviewed. RESULTS: Sclerosis and
      shrinkage of the lesion with concomitant symptom resolution occurred after two
      injections with calcitonin and methylprednisolone via computed tomography (CT)
      guidance. No complications occurred. The lesion remained quiescent at a 2-year
      7-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous intralesional injection of an ABC of
      the first cervical vertebrae with calcitonin and methylprednisolone in a child
      via CT guidance was a safe and effective treatment. This is a promising treatment
      for surgically inaccessible aneurysmal bone cysts.

TI  - Significant reduction in brain swelling by administration of nonpeptide kinin B2 
      receptor antagonist LF 16-0687Ms after controlled cortical impact injury in rats.
PG  - 853-9
AB  - OBJECT: Identification of new therapeutic agents aimed at attenuating
      posttraumatic brain edema formation remains an unresolved challenge. Among
      others, activation of bradykinin B2 receptors is known to mediate the formation
      of brain edema. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective
      effect of the novel nonpeptide B2 receptor antagonist, LF 16-0687Ms, in
      brain-injured rats. METHODS: Focal contusion was produced by controlled cortical 
      impact injury. Five minutes after trauma, the rats received a single dose of no, 
      low- (3 mg/kg body weight), or high- (30 mg/kg) dose LF 16-0687Ms. After 24
      hours, the amount of brain swelling and hemispheric water content were
      determined. Low and high doses of LF 16-0687Ms significantly reduced brain
      swelling by 25% and 27%, respectively (p < 0.03). Hemispheric water content
      tended to be increased in the nontraumatized hemisphere. In a subsequent series
      of 10 rats, cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected to
      determine whether changes in substances associated with edema formation could
      clarify why LF 16-0687Ms increases water content. For this, the volume regulator 
      amino acid taurine, the excitatory transmitter glutamate, and the adenosine
      triphosphate degradation products hypoxanthine and xanthine were measured. In
      CSF, the levels of taurine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were significantly
      decreased following a single administration of LF 16-0687Ms (p < 0.005); the
      level of glutamate, however, was double that found in control animals (p < 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Using the present study design, a single administration of LF
      16-0687Ms successfully reduced posttraumatic brain swelling. The decreased levels
      of taurine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine may reflect reduced posttraumatic brain
      edema, whereas the increased level of glutamate could account for the elevated
      water content observed in the nontraumatized hemisphere.

TI  - Clinical significance of hepatic resection in hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis 
      by disease-free survival curves.
PG  - 1456-9
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The clinical significance of hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) is still controversial because of frequent intrahepatic recurrence, which
      results from either recurrence due to residual intrahepatic metastasis (Rim) or
      recurrence due to metachronous, multicentric liver carcinogenesis (Rmc). DESIGN: 
      Retrospective review. Disease-free survival curves were obtained by the
      Kaplan-Meier method and the rates of Rim and Rmc were analyzed using 2 regression
      lines, based on the evidence that Rmc occurs at a constant rate throughout
      follow-up, whereas Rim occurs only in the early postoperative period. SETTING:
      University hospital. PATIENTS: From 1980 to 1996, 241 patients with HCC who
      underwent curative hepatic resection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Intrahepatic
      recurrence. RESULTS: Disease-free survival curves for all patients in the early
      (within 2 years) and late (4 years after surgery) follow-up were approximated by 
      2 regression lines, which represent both Rim and Rmc (Y(1) = -3.4X + 48) and only
      Rmc (Y(2) = -23.1X + 98). Using this approximation, the annual incidence of Rim
      within 2 years (a(1)-a(2)) was calculated as 19.7% and that of Rmc (a(2)) was
      3.4%. The ratio of Rim in tumor recurrence (b(1)-b(2)) was 50%, and that of Rmc
      (b(1)) was 48%. The ratios of Rmc in patients with stages I and II HCC were 60%
      and 64%, respectively. In contrast, the values could not be calculated in
      patients with stages III and IVA because all but 2 patients showed recurrence
      within 4 years after surgery. CONCLUSION: Tumor recurrence is estimated to result
      from metachronous liver carcinogenesis in 48% of hepatectomized patients with
      HCC.

TI  - Facial autologous soft-tissue contouring by adjunction of tissue cocktail
      injection (micrograft and minigraft mixture of dermis, fascia, and fat).
PG  - 1375-87; discussion 1388-9
AB  - Facial aging is both a physiologic and anatomic process characterized by changes 
      in the skin and supporting tissues. The aging process produces an outer envelope 
      that gradually expands while its contents gradually involute and the underlying
      structure weakens. This process results in an excess of skin that tends to create
      folds, grooves, and deepening furrows. Contour augmentation and filling
      depressions with autologous tissue or heterogeneous materials are widely used in 
      face rejuvenation as an adjunctive procedure. There is unanimous agreement on the
      advantages of autogenous tissue grafts over alloplastic materials and
      heterogeneous transplants. It is also well known that the revascularization of a 
      small graft (fat, dermis, and/or composite graft) is better than a large graft.
      For this reason, fat injections consisting of small particles have recently
      become popular. According to different authors, a graft take may vary from 30 to 
      50 percent. Nevertheless, it has been thoroughly documented that a graft
      consisting of dermis or fascia is superior to a fat graft in both the graft take 
      rate and quality of the tissue. Strips of dermal graft have been used
      successfully for several years to fill lip contour and nasolabial folds. However,
      the main disadvantage of this technique is that utilization is restricted only to
      certain areas where there is a need for a small incision. To overcome this
      obstacle, the author developed a simple technique to obtain an injectable mass
      from a mixture of dermis, muscle strips, fat tissue, and fascia to use in body
      contouring (especially in the facial region) in large areas. The author describes
      the use of the technique in 450 patients. Follow-up in these patients from 6
      months to 10 years showed that the application of the "tissue cocktail" procedure
      in select patients improved the author's results and created a marked increase in
      the number of satisfied patients with no complaints. The take and durability of
      this kind of graft were superior to the author's results using fat grafts. The
      tissue cocktail graft remained stable for several years, as effectively seen in
      the chin region. The sole complication from the procedure was some bruising,
      which was resolved in several days. No single infection or inclusion cyst was
      observed in this series.

TI  - Homocysteine levels during fasting and after methionine loading in adolescents
      with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy.
PG  - 386-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess plasma homocysteine levels in adolescents and young adults
      with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes with and without microvascular
      complications. STUDY DESIGN: Homocysteine levels were measured during fasting and
      after methionine loading in plasma of 61 patients with onset of diabetes before
      the age of 12 years and duration of disease longer than 7 years. They had an
      albumin excretion rate (AER) between 20 and 200 microg/min in 2 of 3 overnight
      urine collections in a period of 6 months and/or retinopathy. Patients with
      persistent microalbuminuria were divided into 2 groups: subjects with AER of 20
      to 70 microg/min and patients with AER of 70 to 200 microg/min. Adolescents (n = 
      54) without signs of diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy and matched control
      subjects (n = 63) were also studied. RESULTS: Homocysteine concentrations before 
      and after methionine load were higher in adolescents with diabetic complications 
      than in healthy subjects (fasting values: 12. 4 +/- 7.9 micromol/L vs 7.8 +/- 4.2
      micromol/L; P <.01; after methionine load: 28.1 +/- 13.2 micromol/L vs 16.6 +/-
      7.3 micromol/L; P <.005). Values of 11.9 micromol/L or higher were considered to 
      constitute fasting hyperhomocysteinemia. The increase of homocysteine
      concentrations was particularly evident in young diabetic patients with AER >70
      microg/min (fasting values: 14.7 +/- 5.6 micromol/L; after methionine load: 34.2 
      +/- 12.6 micromol/L) and in patients with proliferative retinopathy (fasting
      values: 15.1 +/- 5.0 micromol/L; after methionine load: 36.8 +/- 12.5
      micromol/L). CONCLUSIONS: Increased plasma homocysteine concentrations may
      contribute to increased morbidity and death from cardiovascular disease in
      adolescents and young adults with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy.

TI  - Artemisinin derivatives for treating severe malaria.
PG  - CD000527
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artemisinin derivatives may have advantages over quinoline drugs for 
      treating severe malaria since they are fast acting and effective against quinine 
      resistant malaria parasites. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to
      assess the effects of artemisinin drugs for severe and complicated falciparum
      malaria in adults and children. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane
      Infectious Diseases Group trials register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register,
      Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Lilacs, African Index Medicus,
      conference abstracts and reference lists of articles. We contacted organisations,
      researchers in the field and drug companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and
      pseudo-randomised trials comparing artemisinin drugs (rectal, intramuscular or
      intravenous) with standard treatment, or comparisons between artemisinin
      derivatives in adults or children with severe or complicated falciparum malaria. 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Eligibility, trial quality assessment and data
      extraction were done independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted
      for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty three trials are included,
      allocation concealment was adequate in nine. Sixteen trials compared artemisinin 
      drugs with quinine in 2653 patients. Artemisinin drugs were associated with
      better survival (mortality odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.82,
      random effects model). In trials where concealment of allocation was adequate
      (2261 patients), this was barely statistically significant (odds ratio 0.72, 95% 
      CI 0.54 to 0.96, random effects model). In 1939 patients with cerebral malaria,
      mortality was also lower with artemisinin drugs overall (odds ratio 0.63, 95% CI 
      0.44 to 0.88, random effects model). The difference was not significant however
      when only trials reporting adequate concealment of allocation were analysed (odds
      ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.10, random effects model) based on 1607 patients. No
      difference in neurological sequelae was shown. Compared with quinine, artemisinin
      drugs showed faster parasite clearance from the blood and similar adverse
      effects. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The evidence suggests that artemisinin drugs are
      no worse than quinine in preventing death in severe or complicated malaria. No
      artemisinin derivative appears to be better than the others.

TI  - Relation between evolutionary ST segment and T-wave direction and
      electrocardiographic prediction of mycardial infarct size and left ventricular
      function among patients with anterior wall Q-wave acute myocardial infarction who
      received reperfusion therapy.
PG  - 927-33
AB  - In the prethrombolytic era it was found that infarct size and left ventricular
      ejection fraction could be predicted using the Selvester QRS score. We evaluated 
      whether infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction could be predicted by
      the predischarge QRS score in patients who had received reperfusion therapy and
      whether considering the configuration of the ST segments and T waves would
      increase the accuracy of these predictions. We evaluated 51 patients with first
      anterior wall myocardial infarction who had received reperfusion therapy and
      predischarge resting technetium-99m-sestamibi scan. The electrocardiograms
      recorded on the same day of the scan were analyzed for the QRS score and were
      divided into 3 groups: A, isoelectric ST and negative T waves; B, ST elevation (>
      or =0.1 mV) and negative T waves; and C, ST elevation (> or =0.1 mV) and positive
      T waves. Groups A, B, and C included 12, 23, and 16 patients, respectively. The
      myocardial perfusion defect extent increased from groups A to C (median 21%, 37%,
      and 43.5% in groups A, B, and C, respectively; p = 0.023). Similarly, left
      ventricular ejection fraction decreased (44%, 38%, and 34%, respectively; p =
      0.042) from groups A to C. Overall, the correlation between the QRS score and the
      myocardial perfusion defect extent (rho 0.249; p = 0.08) and ejection fraction
      (rho -0.229; p = 0.11) was poor. A statistically significant correlation between 
      myocardial perfusion defect size and QRS score was found only in group A (rho
      0.599, p = 0.04). Among patients with anterior myocardial infarction who received
      reperfusion therapy, the predischarge QRS score was predictive of infarct size
      only in those in whom ST elevation resolved completely. In patients with residual
      ST elevation there was no correlation between QRS score and infarct size.

TI  - Incidence of intravascular penetration in transforaminal lumbosacral epidural
      steroid injections.
PG  - 2628-32
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, observational, human, in vivo study. OBJECTIVES: To 
      evaluate the incidence of vascular penetration during fluoroscopically guided,
      contrast-enhanced, transforaminal lumbar epidural steroid injections (ESIs) and
      determine whether a "flash" (blood in the needle hub) or aspiration of blood can 
      be used to predict a vascular injection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Incorrectly 
      placed, intravascular lumbosacral spinal injections result in systemic medication
      flow that misses the desired target. No previous studies evaluate the incidence
      of vascular injections in transforaminal ESIs, nor the ability of flash to
      predict a vascular injection. METHODS: The incidence of flash or positive blood
      aspiration and the incidence of fluoroscopically confirmed vascular spread were
      prospectively observed in 670 patients treated with lumbosacral fluoroscopically 
      guided transforaminal ESIs. Presence of a flash or positive aspiration was
      documented. Contrast was injected to determine whether the needle tip was
      intravascular. RESULTS: Seven hundred sixty-one transforaminal ESIs were
      included. The overall rate of intravascular injections was 11.2%. There was a
      statistically significant higher rate of intravascular injections (21.3%) noted
      with transforaminal ESIs performed at S1 (n = 178), compared with those at the
      lumbar levels (8.1%, n = 583). Using flash or positive blood aspirate to predict 
      intravascular injections was 97.9% specific, but only 44.7% sensitive.
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a high incidence of intravascular injections in
      transforaminal ESIs that is significantly increased at S1. Using a flash or blood
      aspiration to predict an intravascular injection is not sensitive, and therefore 
      a negative flash or aspiration is not reliable. Fluoroscopically guided
      procedures without contrast confirmation are instilling medications
      intravascularly and therefore not into the desired epidural location. This
      finding confirms the need for not only fluoroscopic guidance but also contrast
      injection instillation in lumbosacral transforaminal ESIs.

TI  - Bone marrow necrosis.
PG  - 1769-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the medical community, little is known regarding bone marrow
      necrosis (BMN) as a clinicopathologic entity, although to the authors' knowledge 
      it was described for the first time more than 50 years ago. To identify the rate 
      of prevalence, the symptoms and signs, the underlying disease associations, and
      the usefulness of diagnostic procedures, an extensive literature search was made.
      METHODS: Only cases identified as extensive necrosis and diagnosed during life
      were selected. Two hundred forty cases met these criteria. RESULTS: Bone pain
      (75%) and fever (68.5%) were the most important symptoms, whereas anemia (91%)
      and thrombocytopenia (78%), associated with a leukoerythroblastic picture (51%), 
      were the most frequent hematologic abnormalities. Nearly 50% of patients showed
      elevated lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels. In 90% of the
      patients an underlying malignancy was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow
      necrosis is caused by hypoxemia after failure of the microcirculation. Given the 
      high rate of malignancy as an underlying disease association, an extensive search
      for neoplastic disease is justified whenever BMN is diagnosed. Pancytopenia and
      embolic processes are major complications that should be managed with supportive

TI  - Living and dying with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - S91-100
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) over
      patients' last 6 months of life. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of a
      prospective cohort from the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for
      Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT). SETTING: Hospitalization for
      exacerbation of COPD at five US teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: COPD patients
      who died within 1 year (n = 416) among 1016 enrolled. METHODS: Interview and
      medical record data were organized into time windows beginning with death and
      ending 6 months earlier. OUTCOME MEASURES: Days in hospital, prognosis, illness
      severity, function, symptoms, patients' preferences, and impacts on families.
      RESULTS: One-year survival was 59%, 39% had > or = 3 comorbidities, and 15 to 25%
      of the patients' last 6 months were in hospitals. Exacerbation etiologies
      included respiratory infection (47%) and cardiac problems (30%). Better quality
      of life predicted longer survival (ARR: 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.87) as did heart
      failure etiology of exacerbation (ARR: 0.57; CI, 0.40, 0.82). Estimates of
      survival by physicians and by prognostic model were well calibrated, although
      patients with the worst prognoses survived longer than predicted. Patients'
      estimates of prognosis were poorly calibrated. One-quarter of patients had
      serious pain throughout, and two-thirds had serious dyspnea. Patients' illnesses 
      had a major impact on more than 25% of families. Patients' preferences for
      Do-Not-Resuscitate orders increased from 40% at 3 to 6 months before death to 77%
      within 1 month of death; their decisions not to use mechanical ventilation
      increased from 12 to 31%, and their preferences for resuscitation decreased from 
      52 to 23%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced COPD often die within 1 year and
      have substantial comorbidities and symptoms. Adequate description anchors
      improved care.

TI  - Indium-111 monoclonal antimyosin cardiac scintigraphy in men with idiopathic
      dilated cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 214-20
AB  - This study examined the prognostic value and the evolution of the heart-to-lung
      ratio of monoclonal antimyosin antibody (MAA) uptake in patients with a diagnosis
      of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). Uptake of indium-111-labeled MAA
      occurs when the myocytes become irreversibly damaged. The study included 29 men
      with IDC followed up for 3 years. The diagnosis was verified by endomyocardial
      biopsy in all patients. Patients who survived beyond 1 year were restudied.
      Baseline heart-to-lung ratio of MAA was 1.74+/-0.22. Multivariate Cox regression 
      analysis revealed that MAA and New York Heart Association class were independent 
      predictors of late mortality, with a hazard ratio of 4.4 (95% confidence interval
      1.1 to 17.9, p = 0.036) and 7.5 (95% confidence interval 2.0 to 28.4, p = 0.003),
      respectively, when heart-to-lung ratio of MAA uptake was > 1.74 and New York
      Heart Association class was >11. When these patients were divided into those with
      chronic IDC (group I [n = 19]) and those with subacute IDC (group II [n = 10]),
      baseline heart-to-lung ratio was 1.7+/-0.2 and 1.86+/-0.25, respectively (p =
      NS). In the surviving patients, on restudy, the heart-to-lung ratio of MAA uptake
      was unchanged in group I (1.64+/-0.20, p = NS), but had decreased to the level of
      group I (1.66+/-0.21 [p = 0.008]) in group II. Thus, men with IDC and a high
      heart-to-lung ratio of MAA uptake have a worse long-term prognosis than patients 
      with a lower ratio. The heart-to-lung ratio of MAA decreases comparably over time
      in subacute IDC and remains stable in chronic IDC.

TI  - Consented testing of newborns and childbearing women for human immunodeficiency
      virus through a newborn metabolic screening program.
PG  - 245-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this program a postpartum woman could consent to receive her
      newborn's human immunodeficiency virus test result from the New York State
      Newborn Screening Program. STUDY DESIGN: By state regulation each postpartum
      woman was counseled and offered her newborn's human immunodeficiency virus test
      result. With the mother's consent, newborn human immunodeficiency virus antibody 
      test results from the Newborn Screening Program were sent to the baby's
      pediatrician; otherwise, test results were blinded. Data were analyzed for births
      from August 1, 1996, to January 31, 1997. RESULTS: Overall, 92.5% of women
      offered newborn human immunodeficiency virus testing consented to receive the
      result. Among 444 human immunodeficiency virus-positive women offered newborn
      testing, consented testing resulted in a 21.4% increase in knowledge of human
      immunodeficiency virus status from 72.3% (n = 321) at delivery to 93.7% (n = 416)
      after newborn testing; 6.3% (n = 28) of human immunodeficiency virus-positive
      women delivered of infants who did not consent apparently remained unaware of
      their human immunodeficiency virus status. CONCLUSION: Combined prenatal and
      consented newborn testing identified 94% of human immunodeficiency virus-positive
      mothers and exposed newborns, allowing early entry into care. Such testing may
      provide an opportunity for women not previously tested for the human
      immunodeficiency virus to learn their status but is not a substitute for
      universal prenatal human immunodeficiency virus counseling and consented human
      immunodeficiency virus testing.

      community health workers in south Sudan. Joyce Kiden relates her experiences as a
      health worker and gives a detailed account on the benefits of the work as well as
      the fulfillment of helping others. Despite some challenges and difficulties, the 
      training that was organized by WHO has made considerable impact on the
      improvement of primary health care services at the community level. Many agencies
      realize importance of community health workers training. These training enhances 
      the basic skills of people and hopefully encourage international donors to
      support not just the international organizations that are vital, but also the
      local people who will make improving health a sustainable possibility.

TI  - The effect of muscle transplantation after unilateral partial facial paralysis on
      craniofacial growth and development: relationship between muscle and nerve
      histomorphometric findings.
PG  - 111-27; discussion 128-9
AB  - Muscle transplantation has become an indispensable tool to restore the smile in
      patients with long-standing or congenital facial paralysis. However, little is
      known of the effect of this surgical intervention on craniofacial growth and
      development or of the adaptation of the transplant to its recipient site under
      circumstances of growth. The present study investigates these phenomena in the
      rabbit model. Twelve-day-old New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to 
      three experimental groups. The control group was used to study normal
      craniofacial growth and development (n = 15). In the nerve ablation group,
      unilateral paralysis of the buccal branches of the facial nerve was surgically
      induced (n = 15). In the transplant group, the surgically induced unilateral
      paralysis of the buccal branches was immediately followed by a neuromuscular
      graft (n = 12). All animals were operated on at the age of 12 days, and follow-up
      evaluations were performed at the ages of 2 months and 6 months. Computerized
      dorsoventral roentgencephalometric and computed tomography investigations were
      performed at both ages. Nerve and muscle histomorphometric measurements were
      performed at the age of 6 months to relate the quality of nerve and muscle
      regeneration to the growth parameters. The roentgencephalometric measurements
      revealed that analogous disturbed parameters were present in the nerve ablation
      and the transplant groups. However, in the transplant group, an additional
      significant effect of time between 2 and 6 months was seen for some parameters.
      This resulted in significant differences between the nerve ablation and
      transplant groups at 6 months for these parameters. Computed tomography
      measurements showed no significant differences in maxillary or mandibular volume 
      in the transplant group compared with the control or nerve ablation groups.
      However, a significantly diminished increase in bone volume existed in the
      transplant group for the time period between 2 and 6 months in comparison with
      the control and nerve ablation groups. Muscle histomorphometric findings revealed
      a significant change in muscle fiber composition in the graft compared with the
      normal latissimus dorsi muscle; this was due to a major decrease in type IIB
      fibers, with an increase in type I and type IIA fibers. Compared with the normal 
      zygomaticoauricular muscle, the amount of type I fibers was significantly
      increased. No fiber atrophy was found. Macroscopically, the transplanted muscle
      failed to increase its length during growth. Nerve histomorphometric findings
      demonstrated a normal amount of nerve fibers; however, they had significantly
      decreased diameters and reduced myelin areas. The nerve histomorphometric
      parameters were related to the muscle histomorphometric findings, which in turn
      were related to craniofacial growth disturbances. These findings suggested that
      the main growth differences between the transplant group and the control group
      may have been due to altered nerve function influencing muscle function. Scar
      tissue formation and the development of more intense muscle activity later are
      suggested as the causes of the additional effect of time between 2 and 6 months
      for the several parameters in the transplant group. Reasons for the failure of
      complete conversion of the graft to a fast muscle and the failure of the
      transplant to elongate during growth are discussed.

TI  - Acinetobacter calcoaceticus pneumonia and the formation of pneumatoceles.
PG  - 964-70
AB  - Pneumatoceles are cystic lesions of the lungs often seen in children with
      staphylococcal pneumonia and positive-pressure ventilation. Acinetobacter
      calcoaceticus is an aerobic, short immobile gram-negative rod, or coccobacillus, 
      which is an omnipresent saprophyte. The variant anitratus is the most clinically 
      significant pathogen in this family, usually presenting as a lower respiratory
      tract infection. Acinetobacter has been demonstrated to be one of the most common
      organisms found in the ICU. We present three critically ill surgery patients with
      Acinetobacter pneumonia, high inspiratory pressures, and the subsequent
      development of pneumatoceles. One of these patients died from a ruptured
      pneumatocele, resulting in tension pneumothorax. Treatment of pneumatoceles
      should center on appropriate intravenous antimicrobial therapy. This should be
      culture directed but is most often accomplished with Imipenem. Percutaneous,
      computed tomographic-guided catheter placement or direct tube thoracostomy
      decompression of the pneumatocele may prevent subsequent rupture and potentially 
      lethal tension pneumothorax.

TI  - Magnesium sulfate therapy affects attention and working memory in patients
      undergoing preterm labor.
PG  - 940-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients commonly consent to undergoing invasive procedures while
      receiving magnesium sulfate therapy. This study evaluated the effects of
      magnesium sulfate on attention, comprehension, and memory in patients undergoing 
      preterm labor. STUDY DESIGN: Consenting patients were studied while
      receiving(study) and not receiving (control) intravenous magnesium sulfate
      tocolysis for preterm labor. Excluded were patients with possible preeclampsia,
      imminent delivery, sedative administration, or prior mental illness. Patient
      comprehension was assessed with the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. Level 
      of attention and working memory were evaluated with the Paced Auditory Serial
      Addition Test. Verbal learning, short-term memory, and recognition were
      determined with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Gross mental-neurologic
      deficits were evaluated with the Mini-Mental Status Examination. The tests were
      administered by the same examiner. Control testing was performed >24 hours after 
      intravenous magnesium sulfate was discontinued. Magnesium levels were obtained at
      the time of testing. The primary outcome measure was the Paced Auditory Serial
      Addition Test score because of its ability to elicit subtle differences in
      attention capacity. Statistical analysis included the paired t test and the
      McNemar test. RESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the study. Paced Auditory
      Serial Addition Test scores were significantly higher (ie, more errors were made)
      during magnesium sulfate therapy than periods without therapy (14 +/- 8 vs 7 +/- 
      7; P <.05). Comprehension (Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination score) was not
      different between the groups (P =.7). There was no difference in short-term
      memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test) or gross mental-neurologic deficits between
      the 2 groups (all P >.1). CONCLUSIONS: Magnesium sulfate therapy appears to have 
      an effect on attention and working memory but not on long-term memory or
      comprehension. The significant differences in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test
      scores reveal deficits in information-processing ability in patients on a regimen
      of magnesium sulfate therapy.

TI  - Effects of a loading dose regimen of three infusions of chimeric monoclonal
      antibody to tumour necrosis factor alpha (infliximab) in spondyloarthropathy: an 
      open pilot study.
PG  - 428-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a loading dose regimen of three
      intravenous infusions with infliximab in patients with active
      spondyloarthropathy. METHODS: A monocentre, open-label pilot study of 21 patients
      with different subtypes of spondyloarthropathy was conducted. Treatment resistant
      patients with active disease (fulfilling inclusion criteria) received three
      infusions of 5 mg/kg infliximab (at weeks 0, 2, and 6). Standard clinical
      assessments were performed at baseline, and on days 3, 7, and 14, and from then
      on every two weeks. In patients who fulfilled criteria for ankylosing
      spondylitis, axial assessment was performed at baseline and on days 14, 42, and
      84. RESULTS: In all global assessments (visual analogue scale of patient global
      assessment, patient pain assessment, doctor global assessment), erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, and C reactive protein, a highly significant decrease could
      be seen already at day 3 (compared with baseline), which was maintained up to day
      84. In patients with peripheral disease (n=18), tender and swollen joint count
      significantly decreased. In patients with axial disease (n=11), functional and
      disease activity indices significantly improved. Moreover in eight patients with 
      psoriatic arthritis a significant decrease of the psoriasis area and severity
      index was observed. The treatment was well tolerated in all patients; no
      significant adverse events were seen. CONCLUSION: In this open-label pilot study 
      of a loading dose regimen of three infusions of chimeric monoclonal antibody to
      tumour necrosis factor alpha in patients with active spondyloarthropathy, there
      was a fast and significant improvement of axial and peripheral articular
      manifestations, without major adverse experiences.

TI  - Low molecular weight heparin in acute coronary syndrome: evidence for superior or
      equivalent efficacy compared with unfractionated heparin?
PG  - 1699-712
AB  - This article will review the results of recent clinical trials evaluating low
      molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) in the management of patients with acute
      coronary syndromes of unstable angina and non-ST segment elevation MI. Low
      molecular weight heparins are a new class of anticoagulants that have a number of
      advantages over unfractionated heparin (UFH) leading to their increasing use for 
      thrombotic vascular disorders. There is convincing evidence that LMWH is more
      effective than placebo and at least as effective as UFH in reducing the hard end 
      points of death and recurrent myocardial infarction. Convincing evidence for a
      superior efficacy is mostly limited to the least robust but most prevalent end
      point of recurrent angina, and benefits appear to be confined predominantly to
      high-risk patients. The benefits are sustained long-term, but there appears to be
      no incremental benefit with prolonged treatment. The risk for major bleeding is
      approximately equivalent to UFH, but minor hemorrhage is clearly increased,
      especially with vascular instrumentation. The increased bleeding risk together
      with its long half-life and absence of specific antidote warrants exercising
      caution when using LMWH with coronary intervention. Low molecular weight heparins
      have the potential of being cost-neutral or even cost-saving by reducing resource
      utilization, especially in the setting of aggressive interventional practice
      pattern. Last, the issue of whether one LMWH preparation is more effective and
      cost-effective than others remains an open question that can be answered only by 
      direct head-to-head comparison of different LMWH preparations in randomized
      trials. In conclusion, subcutaneous weight-adjusted LMWH is as effective and safe
      as intravenous UFH in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes.
      The logistic ease of administration without the need for monitoring
      anticoagulation appears to be the major advantage over UFH.

TI  - Expert decision making in relation to unanticipated blood glucose levels.
PG  - 147-57
AB  - How people (N = 22) with long-standing Type I diabetes make everyday self-care
      decisions, specifically in regard to unanticipated blood glucose levels (UBGLs)
      was investigated using grounded theory. Participants differentiated between
      decisions made in familiar and typical situations and those made in novel
      situations. Decisions made in familiar situations were straightforward, arising
      from a confident appraisal of the cause of the UBGL. The primary focus of
      decision making in response to an UBGL in familiar situations was the decision
      about the course of action. The focus in unfamiliar situations was the appraisal 
      of the cause of the UBGL. It was characterized by the participants' lack of
      confidence and by a non-linear progression in which the individual retraced
      previous phases of the decision-making process or proceeded to tangential steps. 
      Participants matched the features of previously encountered situations to
      construct a story that explained the events in order to generate some plausible
      hypotheses. A number of contextual and mediating variables were identified as
      influencing the decision-making process and the decisions they made. The findings
      of this research demonstrate that the decision maker's familiarity with the
      situation influences the nature of the decision-making processes that are used.

TI  - Memory complaint in a community sample aged 70 and older.
PG  - 1435-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The ability of older people to estimate their own memory, often
      referred to as "metamemory," has been evaluated in previous studies with
      conflicting reports regarding accuracy. Some studies have suggested that an older
      person's metamemory is mostly accurate, whereas others have demonstrated little
      relationship between memory complaint and actual impairment. This study examines 
      memory complaint in a large national sample of older people aged > or = 70.
      DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study with two waves of data collection spaced 2
      years apart. SETTING: A nationwide random sample of community-dwelling older
      persons. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5,444 community-dwelling persons aged > or = 70
      and their spouses. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked if they believed their
      memory was excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. They were then administered
      a cognitive assessment derived from the Mini-Mental Status Exam. RESULTS: In
      general, people's assessment of their memory corresponded with their actual
      performance on cognitive measures. However, large portions of the sample
      inaccurately assessed their memory skills. People who reported depressive
      symptoms and had impairment in activities of daily living were more likely to
      state that their memory was impaired, although they performed very well on
      cognitive measures. CONCLUSIONS: The conditions that skew people's
      self-assessment are the ones most likely to bring them into contact with
      healthcare professionals. This may give clinicians the general impression that
      older people cannot assess their own cognitive skills. However, poor metamemory
      appears to be a characteristic of a specific subgroup of older persons, not
      necessarily characteristic of the general population.

TI  - CT in the selection of patients with abdominal or pelvic sarcoma for reoperative 
      surgery.
PG  - 700-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retroperitoneal or visceral sarcoma may recur with disease limited to
      the abdomen and pelvis. In this clinical situation, further surgical treatments
      in an attempt to control the disease may be appropriate. CT is used to help
      select patients for additional surgical interventions. STUDY DESIGN: Preoperative
      abdominal and pelvic CT scans of 33 patients with recurrent sarcoma were reviewed
      retrospectively. All patients underwent reoperative surgery and, when
      appropriate, perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Patients were divided
      into two groups according to survival and disease status: alive with no evidence 
      of disease (n = 7) and alive with disease or dead of disease (n = 26). Twenty-two
      CT indices were studied retrospectively for each patient and evaluated
      statistically. RESULTS: The presence of large (greater than 5 cm) tumor volume in
      3 of the 13 abdominopelvic regions resulted in a significant difference in the
      prognosis between the groups of patients. These findings included tumor in the
      left lower quadrant (p = 0.032), tumor in the pelvis (p = 0.008), and tumor in
      the distal jejunum (p = 0.032). Two other CT indices that showed a significant
      difference in survival between the groups were involvement of five abdominopelvic
      regions or fewer (p = 0.008) and a peritoneal cancer index of 15 or less (p =
      0.03). A statistical approach using a tree-structured diagram showed that
      patients with tumor diameter greater than 5 cm in the pelvis accompanied by tumor
      involvement of more than one segment of small bowel had a 0% probability of
      postoperative disease-free survival. In contrast, patients with tumor diameter
      less than 5 cm in the pelvis on CT had an 86% probability of disease-free
      survival. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with recurrent sarcoma, selection criteria
      were generated by a preoperative CT of the abdomen and pelvis. In this disease,
      CT was a reliable diagnostic test for predicting benefit from further surgical
      interventions and should be used in the future to help select patients for an
      aggressive versus a palliative approach.

TI  - 21st Century: Review: Ageing and medicine.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - Throughout the world, populations are ageing. The response of the health services
      needs to be based on a knowledge of the nature of human ageing and the principles
      of rational health care for older people. Ageing comes about from interactions
      between intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environment and lifestyle) factors.
      Health care has to be responsive to the general needs of older people, but also
      to recognize the heterogeneity produced by different rates and patterns of
      individual ageing. There are now real possibilities of improving the course of
      human ageing through modulation of both intrinsic and extrinsic processes. There 
      is also a need to adapt social institutions to what is a permanent change in
      demography.

TI  - Limbic lobe of the human brain: evaluation with turbo fluid-attenuated
      inversion-recovery MR imaging.
PG  - 470-5
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether brain cortices have different signal intensities on
      turbo fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) images.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Coronal 5-mm-thick turbo FLAIR MR images in 56
      neurologically normal patients (27 male and 29 female patients; age range, 12-73 
      years; mean age, 47 years) were evaluated retrospectively. Cortical signal
      intensities in the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, subcallosal area,
      insula, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe were graded relative to 
      cortical signal intensity in the frontal lobe. Contrast-to-noise ratios were
      compared for each cortical area. RESULTS: Increased signal intensity was
      frequently seen in the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and subcallosal
      area, regardless of patient age. Signal intensities of temporal, parietal, and
      occipital cortices were similar to that of frontal cortex, and signal intensity
      of the insula was slightly higher than that of frontal cortex. There were no
      significant differences with respect to sex and laterality, whereas significant
      differences were found among cortical regions (P <.01). The contrast-to-noise
      ratios of the amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and subcallosal area were
      significantly greater than those of all other gray matter structures (P <.05).
      CONCLUSION: On turbo FLAIR images, high signal intensities of cortices of the
      limbic lobe are frequently seen in neurologically normal brain. These findings
      should not be considered abnormal.

TI  - Total hip arthroplasty in patients with below-knee amputations.
PG  - 999-1002
AB  - We present a unique small group of 5 patients with below-knee amputation who
      underwent total hip arthroplasty after a displaced subcapital fracture of the
      femur. Three patients were operated on after failed fixation of the fracture, and
      2 were operated on as a primary procedure. All 5 patients resumed their
      prefracture level of activity and mobilization with no deterioration during
      follow-up (average, 69 months [range, 22-98]). These encouraging results call for
      use of total hip arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty as the primary treatment
      modalities of patients with displaced subcapital femoral head fracture in an
      extremity with below-knee amputation.

AB  - We report the first case of a girl with vertically acquired human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, who developed invasive squamous cell
      carcinoma of the vulva at 12 years of age. Lesions resembling bowenoid papulosis 
      covered the perianal area as well. She underwent a nonmutilating surgical
      excision of the infiltrating lesion. More than 3 years later, her clinical
      condition is excellent, although dysplastic, noninfiltrating multifocal lesions
      persist. This case highlights the need to perform careful periodic genital
      examinations in all HIV-infected children and adolescents born to HIV-positive
      mothers.

TI  - Mast cells, extracellular matrix components, TGFbeta isoforms and TGFbeta
      receptor expression in labial salivary glands in systemic sclerosis.
PG  - 183-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was altered elaboration of non-collagenous 
      extracellular matrix proteins or expression of TGFbeta isoforms and their
      receptors in salivary glands of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and
      Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). Because of the possible role of mast cells in the
      early stages of SSc their presence was also investigated. METHODS: Sections of
      normal labial salivary glands (n=10) and glands from patients with SSc (n = 13)
      and RP (n = 5) were stained immunohistochemically and using acid toluidine blue. 
      RESULTS: SSc glands contained more mast cells than control tissues (p<0.005) and 
      similar numbers to those found in RP specimens. There were no differences in the 
      pattern or amount of non-collagenous matrix proteins detected. Tenascin and
      elastin were predominantly found surrounding ducts whereas fibronectin had a more
      general distribution. TGFbeta isoforms and receptors were expressed by glandular 
      epithelium, fibroblasts, vascular endothelium and inflammatory cells. Cell counts
      showed no differences in expression of TGFbeta1 or TGFbeta receptors between
      groups. However, the percentage of TGFbeta2 positive fibroblasts was
      significantly higher in SSc glands compared with controls (p<0.004). RP glands
      showed an intermediate level of expression. By contrast, a lower percentage of RP
      fibrolasts expressed TGFbeta3 compared with controls with SSc glands showing an
      intermediate level of expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that (a) there 
      are no changes in glandular expression of tenascin, elastin and fibronectin in
      SSc and RP and (b) both conditions are associated with an increased salivary
      gland mast cell population and changes in expression of TGFbeta2 and beta3
      isoforms by glandular fibroblasts.

TI  - Cycling injuries treated in emergency departments: need for bicycle helmets among
      preschoolers.
PG  - 1096-100
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence, circumstances, and severity of
      bicycle-related injuries among children treated in US emergency departments (EDs)
      and to compare injuries in children aged 1 to 4 years (young children) with those
      in children and adolescents aged 5-9 and 10-14 years (intermediate-age and older 
      children, respectively). DESIGN: Emergency department survey from the National
      Center for Health Statistics National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for
      January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1997. PATIENTS: National probability sample
      of patients who sought care in EDs; data for children 1 to 14 years old were
      used. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and description of bicycle-related injuries
      among children grouped by age treated in US EDs. RESULTS: The 6-year weighted
      estimate of bicycle-associated injuries was 2,176,173. Young children had 270,098
      ED visits; their average annual incidence was 45,016, a rate of 28.8 per 10,000
      (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.1-38.5). Children in the intermediate-age and
      older groups had an incidence of 82.0 (95% CI, 66.6-97.4); and 86.4 (95% CI,
      70.4-102.4) per 10,000, respectively. The highest rates of bicycle-related
      injuries were observed among boys in the intermediate-age (108.3 per 10,000 per
      year) and older groups (123.8 per 10,000 per year). Few injured children were
      involved in collisions with motor vehicles (<1% of young and 4% of
      intermediate-age groups). The annual incidence of head trauma was 4.0 per 10,000 
      (95% CI, 0.4-7.5) for young children, 9.3 per 10,000 (95% CI, 4.3-14.2) for
      intermediate-age children, and 8.1 per 10,000 (95% CI, 3.5-12.8) for older
      children. Children aged 5 to 9 years had the highest rates of face trauma
      (estimated 29.8 per 10,000). The incidence of extremity fractures (range,
      6.9-17.6 per 10,000) was similar for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although boys in
      the intermediate-age and older groups have the highest incidence of
      bicycle-related injuries, young children are also commonly injured. The anatomic 
      sites of injury among young cyclists (head and face trauma and extremity
      fractures) are similar to those observed in both other groups. Bicycle helmets
      are indicated for the youngest children as well.

      quadriplegia: a case report.
PG  - 1450-2
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report.- OBJECTIVE: To highlight the evaluation and
      treatment of neonatal infectious spondylitis of the cervical spine. SUMMARY OF
      BACKGROUND DATA: Most authors advise intravenous antibiotics as first-choice
      treatment. The place of aspiration or operative drainage is debated, as is the
      position and duration of immobilization. METHODS: A 3-week-old neonate was
      presented with intermittent quadriplegia. RESULTS: Additional investigation
      demonstrated an osteolytic process in the body of C3 with a large epidural
      abscess compressing the spinal cord. Because an infectious spondylitis of C3 was 
      suspected, aspiration of the abscess was performed, and antibiotic therapy was
      started. The patient improved to neurologically normal within 3 weeks and remains
      asymptomatic throughout a follow-up period of 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal
      infectious spondylitis should be diagnosed early and treated promptly; otherwise,
      it may have devastating consequences.

TI  - Lack of association of 3 functional gene variants with hypertension in African
      Americans.
PG  - 1297-300
AB  - African Americans are a critical population in which to study the impact of
      physiologically important candidate gene mutations on the occurrence of
      hypertension. African Americans not only have a higher prevalence of
      hypertension, but the disease strikes earlier, with greater severity, and often
      results in death at an earlier age compared with whites in the United States. In 
      this study, 3 physiologically important candidate gene mutations (angiotensinogen
      A[-6], alpha-Adducin Gly460Trp, and G-Protein beta(3)-subunit C825T) were
      examined for their association with hypertension status in a sample of 904
      African Americans from Jackson, Mississippi. Tests of simple association and
      multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed no association between
      hypertension status and any of the studied polymorphisms. This lack of
      association persisted after stratification of the sample by gender and body size.
      These data indicate that these polymorphisms do not contribute in a significant
      way to interindividual variation in the risk of hypertension in this sample of
      African Americans, and further genome-wide studies should be performed to
      identify genes that may influence blood pressure levels in this population.

TI  - Community care and criminal offending in schizophrenia.
PG  - 614-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of community care in psychiatry is widely thought to
      have resulted in more offending among the seriously mentally ill. This view
      affects public policy towards and public perceptions of such people. We
      investigated the association between the introduction of community care and the
      pattern of offending in patients with schizophrenia in Victoria, Australia.
      METHODS: We established patterns of offending from criminal records in two groups
      of patients with schizophrenia over their lifetime to date and in the 10 years
      after their first hospital admission. One group was first admitted in 1975 before
      major deinstitutionalisation in Victoria, the second group in 1985 when community
      care was becoming the norm. Each patient was matched to a control, by age, sex,
      and place of residence to allow for changing patterns of offending over time in
      the wider community. FINDINGS: Compared with controls, significantly more of
      those with schizophrenia were convicted at least once for all categories of
      criminal offending except sexual offences (relative risk of offending in 1975=3.5
      [95% CI 2.0-5.5), p=0.001, in 1985=3.0 [1.9-4.9], p=0.001). Among men, more
      offences were committed in the 1985 group than the 1975 group, but this was
      matched by a similar increase in convictions among the community controls. Those 
      with schizophrenia who had also received treatment for substance abuse accounted 
      for a disproportionate amount of offending. Analysis of admission data for the
      patients and the total population of admissions with schizophrenia showed that
      although there had been an increase of 74 days per annum spent in the community
      for each of the study population as a whole, first admissions spent only 1 more
      day in the community in 1985 compared with 1975. INTERPRETATION: Increased rates 
      in criminal conviction for those with schizophrenia over the last 20 years are
      consistent with change in the pattern of offending in the general community.
      Deinstitutionalisation does not adequately explain such change. Mental-health
      services should aim to reduce the raised rates of criminal offending associated
      with schizophrenia, but turning the clock back on community care is unlikely to
      contribute towards any positive outcome.

TI  - Time-dependent increases in type-III collagen gene expression in medical
      collateral ligament fibroblasts under cyclic strains.
PG  - 220-7
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated the capacity of mechanical strains to modulate
      cell behavior through several different signaling pathways. Understanding the
      response of ligament fibroblasts to mechanically induced strains may provide
      useful knowledge for treating ligament injury and improving rehabilitation
      regimens. Biomechanical studies that quantify strains in the anterior cruciate
      and medial collateral ligaments have shown that these ligaments are subjected to 
      4-5% strains during normal activities and can be strained to 7.7% during external
      application of loads to the knee joint. The objective of this study was to
      characterize the expression of types I and III collagen in fibroblast monolayers 
      of anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments subjected to equibiaxial
      strains on flexible growth surfaces (0.05 and 0.075 strains) by quantifying
      levels of mRNA encoding these two proteins. Both cyclic strain magnitudes were
      studied under a frequency of 1 Hz. The results indicated marked differences in
      responses to strain regimens not only between types I and III collagen mRNA
      expression within each cell type but also in patterns of expression between
      anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament cells. Whereas anterior cruciate
      ligament fibroblasts responded to cyclic strains by expression of higher levels
      of type-I collagen message with almost no significant increases in type-III
      collagen, medial collateral ligament fibroblasts exhibited statistically
      significant increases in type-III collagen mRNA at all time points after
      initiation of strain with almost no significant increases in type-I collagen.
      Furthermore, differences in responses by fibroblasts from the two ligaments were 
      detected between the two strain magnitudes. In particular, 0.075 strains induced 
      a time-dependent increase in type-III collagen mRNA levels in medial collateral
      ligament fibroblasts whereas 0.05 strains did not. The strain-induced changes in 
      gene expression of these two collagens may have implications for the healing
      processes in ligament tissue. The differences may explain, in part, the healing
      differential between the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in
      vivo.

TI  - Age-dependent decline of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:
      impact of remission definition and symptom type.
PG  - 816-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Symptom decline in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was
      examined with different definitions of remission. METHOD: Symptoms in 128 boys
      were measured five times over 4 years. The prevalences of syndromatic (less than 
      full syndrome), symptomatic (less than subthreshold diagnosis), and functional
      (full recovery) remission were estimated as a function of age with multivariate
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Age was significantly associated with decline in
      total ADHD symptoms and symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. 
      Symptoms of inattention remitted for fewer subjects than did symptoms of
      hyperactivity or impulsivity. The proportion of subjects experiencing remission
      varied considerably with the definition used (highest for syndromatic remission, 
      lowest for functional remission). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that
      differences in reported remission rates reflect the definition used rather than
      the disorder's course. They provide systematic support for the clinical
      observation that hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms tend to decline at a
      higher rate than inattention symptoms.

TI  - Reliability of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting posterior ligament complex
      injury in thoracolumbar spinal fractures.
PG  - 2079-84
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of 34 patients with thoracolumbar spinal
      fractures. OBJECTIVES: To assess the reliability of magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) for posterior ligament complex injury in thoracolumbar spinal fractures.
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Some researchers have studied posterior ligament
      complex injury in spinal fracture using MRI. However, most did not evaluate the
      findings of MRI compared with the operative findings. METHODS: Thirty-four
      patients with thoracolumbar spinal fracture were evaluated by palpation of the
      interspinous gap, plain radiography, and MRI before operation. In addition to
      conventional MRI sequences, a fat-suppressed T2-weighted sagittal sequence was
      performed. Surgery was performed by a posterior approach. During the operation,
      posterior ligament complex injury was carefully examined. RESULTS: A wide
      interspinous gap was palpated in 14 patients and was found in 21 patients on
      plain radiography. Magnetic resonance imaging raised suspicion of injury to the
      posterior ligament complex in 30 patients. According to interpretation of MRI,
      injury to the supraspinous ligament was suspected in 27 patients, the
      interspinous ligament in 30 patients, and the ligamentum flavum in 9 patients.
      There were 28 supraspinous ligament injuries, 29 interspinous ligament injuries, 
      and 7 ligamentum flavum injuries in operative findings. There was a significant
      relation between MRI interpretation and operative findings. CONCLUSION: A
      fat-suppressed T2-weighted sagittal sequence of MRI was a highly sensitive,
      specific, and accurate method of evaluating posterior ligament complex injury.
      Based on the results of this study, a fat-suppressed T2-weighted sagittal
      sequence of MRIs is recommended for the accurate evaluation of posterior ligament
      complex injury and would be helpful in the selection of treatment options.

TI  - Uterine arterial embolization: factors influencing patient radiation exposure.
PG  - 713-22
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate patient radiation exposures during uterine arterial
      embolization and the factors responsible for those exposures. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Clinical and procedural factors were evaluated for 42 consecutive
      procedures performed in 39 patients by one operator. Seven patients were excluded
      because of early termination (n = 1) or unusual conditions that necessitated
      extended procedures (n = 6). Fluoroscopic time, number of images acquired,
      height, and weight were available in the 35 remaining patients, and dose-area
      product (DAP) was available in 20. Equipment factors were evaluated by using a
      Lucite phantom in four angiography units from three manufacturers. RESULTS: The
      mean fluoroscopic time per case decreased from 30.6 to 14.2 minutes between the
      1st and 5th quintiles. Mean DAP decreased from 211.4 to 30.6 Gy. cm(2) with dose 
      reduction techniques; this primarily reflected a decreased number of acquired
      images. Phantom studies demonstrated many significant dose variations with
      magnification and equipment position. Low-dose and pulsed fluoroscopic modes
      reduced exposure rates in units so equipped, but roadmapping caused a silent
      switch to continuous fluoroscopy in two such units, which doubled the exposure
      rate. CONCLUSION: With operator experience and careful technique, uterine
      arterial embolization can be performed at radiation exposures comparable to those
      used in routine diagnostic studies. However, operators must be familiar with the 
      technical parameters of their angiographic equipment.

      ontogeny and cellular distribution of the alphaENaC subunit mRNA expression was
      studied in normal, immature, and abnormal (hypoplastic) human fetal lungs using
      nonradioisotopic in situ hybridization. Surprisingly, alphaENaC expression was
      detected at the embryonic stage of normal lung development (4 to 5 wk gestation) 
      when expression was localized to the fetal lung bud epithelium. By late
      gestation, ENaC was expressed in the conductive and respiratory airway
      epithelium, serous cells, and the distal lung unit in an alveolar type II (ATII) 
      epitheliumlike distribution. Significant alphaENaC expression was found in
      newborn lung diseases associated with respiratory distress. One explanation is
      that alphaENaC mRNA is constitutively expressed, and that activity is regulated, 
      at least in part, at the post-transcriptional level. Alternative explanations are
      that the expression of the beta or gammaENaC subunits may be impaired in certain 
      newborn lung diseases or that alternate Na(+) permeant channels or transporters
      are important to lung liquid absorption in humans at birth.

AB  - Chronic opioid administration induces adaptations in neurones resulting in opioid

      channels (L-type) associated with tolerance and supersensitivity to the
      antinociceptive effect of the micro-opioid receptor agonist sufentanil were
      analyzed in the central nervous system (CNS) of rats. Autoradiographic assays
      were performed with [(3)H]PN-200-110 (isopropyl 4-(2,1,
      3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,4-dihydro-2,
      6-dimethyl-5-methoxycarbonylpyridine-3-carboxylate). Chronic s.c. infusion of
      sufentanil (2 microg/h) for 7 days, which has been shown to induce tolerance to
      the opioid antinociceptive effect, produced an up-regulation of DHP binding
      sites. The highest increases in density were localized in regions involved in
      nociceptive transmission and perception, such as the dorsal horn of the spinal
      cord, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the central grey matter, the thalamic nuclei, and
      the somatosensory cortex. Animals were rendered supersensitive to the
      antinociceptive effect of sufentanil by chronic and simultaneous infusion of
      sufentanil (2 microg/h) and nimodipine (1 microg/h) for 7 days. Under these
      conditions, a greater increase in the number of DHP binding sites was observed in
      the spinal cord, central grey matter, dorsal raphe nucleus, and somatosensory
      neocortex, when compared to the sufentanil group. The role of an increased influx
      through L-type channels in opioid tolerance is reinforced, whereas their
      persistent blockade is essential for the expression of opioid supersensitivity.

TI  - Alcohol consumption in the Baltic Republics.
PG  - 361-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Premature mortality associated with alcohol intake is of
      particular concern in several countries of the former Soviet Union. This study
      explored self reported alcohol consumption (beer, wine, spirits) and its
      determinants in the Baltic Republics. DESIGN: Cross sectional surveys conducted
      in 1997. SETTINGS: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. PARTICIPANTS: Representative
      samples of adults age 19-64 (Estonia n=2010; Latvia n=2258; Lithuania n=2139).
      METHODS: Between country differences in the frequency of alcohol intake were
      estimated. The odds of consuming alcohol weekly according to socioeconomic
      characteristics (age, ethnicity, rural/urban area, education, income) were
      calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusting for all
      variables simultaneously. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of respondents consuming
      alcohol weekly varied by country (p<0.001) (men: Estonia=61% Latvia=41%
      Lithuania=55%; women: Estonia=26% Latvia=8% Lithuania=14%). Within each country, 
      this proportion decreased with age in both sexes (p<0. 001), and increased with
      income in women (p<0.01). In Estonia, the odds of drinking alcohol weekly was
      significantly lower in respondents of Russian than of Estonian ethnicity (odds
      ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI): men=0.51 (0.36, 0.71); women=0.
      57 (0.39, 0.81)). In Lithuania, the odds was higher in highly educated men than
      in those with a low education level (OR=1.48 (1.01, 2.17)). Daily alcohol intake 
      was higher in Estonia than in the other countries, as was the percentage of
      respondents drinking heavily (equivalent to 80 g/day). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately
      half the men and one in six women in the Baltic States reported consuming alcohol
      at least weekly. Age and income were the strongest and most consistent correlates
      of the likelihood of consuming alcohol weekly. Ethnic differences were observed
      only in Estonia.

TI  - Highway cowboys, old hands, and Christian truckers: risk behavior for human
      immunodeficiency virus infection among long-haul truckers in Florida.
PG  - 737-49
AB  - This paper reports the results of ethnographic research to describe risk for
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among long-haul truck drivers and
      the contexts and factors that influence risk and protective behaviors. Drivers
      were selected using purposive and snowball sampling at trucking-related
      businesses along major truck routes in Florida. Interview information was used to
      categorize truckers' levels of potential risk, describe behavioral
      characteristics of each group, identify sex partners, and assess perceptions of
      the risk of HIV infection. One-third of the 71 men interviewed had frequent
      sexual intercourse on the road with multiple partners, but few ever used condoms.
      Commercial sex workers were their most frequent partners for on-the-road sex. The
      risk was compounded by occupational conditions, which motivated truckers to drive
      long hours, often using drugs to stay alert. Sex, alcohol, and drugs were
      perceived as quick, effective stress relievers during downtime on long, lonely
      trips. Despite their high-risk behaviors, truckers tended to consider themselves 
      at low risk for HIV infection and expressed a number of misconceptions regarding 
      HIV transmission. For example, many truckers did not associate HIV risk with
      heterosexual contact or think that condoms were effective in preventing HIV
      transmission. In addition, many truckers maintained strong homophobic and
      anti-government opinions that reinforced their suspicion of safe-sex messages.
      These findings suggest that high-risk sexual behavior is common among long-haul
      truckers in the US, who may be at risk for HIV infection primarily because of
      unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple sex partners. Also, drug use may be 
      associated with HIV risk behavior. The authors recommend establishing prevention 
      programs that are developed by and for truckers, determining HIV seroprevalence
      rates of truckers, addressing drug and alcohol abuse among truckers, and altering
      industry policy that keeps truckers on the road too long for their own and
      others' safety.

TI  - Verbal working memory impairment in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree
      relatives: evidence from the digit span task.
PG  - 275-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The evidence for verbal working memory deficits in schizophrenia has
      been inconsistent. Few studies have evaluated verbal working memory in the
      first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients, who likely share the genetic
      diathesis for schizophrenia but not the potential confounds associated with
      chronic mental illness. METHOD: The Wechsler Digit Span Task was used to
      investigate verbal working memory in 52 schizophrenia patients, 56 of their
      first-degree relatives, and 73 nonpsychiatric comparison subjects. RESULTS: The
      nonpsychotic relatives showed no impairment on the forward digit span task, a
      measure of general attention, but did show impairment on the backward digit span 
      task, a measure of verbal working memory. Schizophrenia patients showed
      impairment on both the forward and backward digit span tasks. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results indicate that the forward and backward digit span tasks tap different
      cognitive abilities that are differentially associated with the diathesis for
      schizophrenia. Working memory deficits associated with schizophrenia appear to be
      generalized and not limited to the spatial modality.

TI  - Perinatal risk factors for asthma in Finnish adolescent twins.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that, in addition to genetic
      liability and environment in early childhood, intrauterine life also influences
      the risk for asthma beyond childhood. Low birth weight, prematurity, young
      maternal age, and maternal smoking have all shown an association with asthma. The
      effect of perinatal factors on the risk for asthma in relation to familial and
      social risk factors was studied in a nationwide population-based sample of
      adolescent twins. In addition to a distribution of birth characteristics among
      twins which differs from that of singletons, data on twins enable a distinction
      to be made between genetic and environmental sources of variation. METHODS:
      Questionnaires were sent to five consecutive birth cohorts of Finnish 16 year old
      twins born in 1975-9 and to their parents (3065 families). The outcome measure
      was life time prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma in these adolescents. The
      association between asthma and potential risk factors was assessed by multiple
      logistic regression and discordant twin pair analysis. RESULTS: Risk for asthma
      increased with increasing ponderal index (p for trend <0.01) and decreasing
      maternal age (p for trend <0.05). Among the 25% of twins with the highest
      ponderal index, the odds ratio for asthma was 1.82 (95% confidence interval 1.18 
      to 2.79) compared with those in the lowest 25%. Neither birth weight, gestational
      age, nor Apgar score was associated with asthma. When perinatal risk factors were
      combined with familial and social risk factors, ponderal index, maternal smoking,
      parental asthma, and sibship size were all significant independent determinants
      of asthma in these adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for asthma in adolescent
      twins increases with increasing ponderal index when adjusted for familial and
      social factors.

TI  - Analysis of prognosis and disease progression after local recurrence of melanoma.
PG  - 1063-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Local recurrence of melanoma is associated with a grave prognosis.
      However, the characteristics and the mode of disease progression for patients
      with local recurrence have not been adequately addressed in the literature.
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients treated at a single institution
      revealed a subset of patients (n = 648) with local recurrence of melanoma as a
      first event. Patient characteristics, histologic determinants, and disease free
      interval were variables used to identify prognostic factors. RESULTS: In this
      group of patients, male gender (P = 0. 0163), increasing age (P = 0.0001), head
      and neck primaries (P = 0. 0001), thicker Breslow depths (P = 0.0022), deeper
      Clark levels (P = 0.0010), and ulceration of the primary tumor (P = 0.0348)
      suggested a shorter time until local recurrence. Breslow depth (P = 0.0004),
      Clark level (P = 0.0043), and ulceration (P = 0.0001) still factored into the
      survival prognosis after recurrence. Truncal primaries (P = 0.0005) and shorter
      disease free intervals (P = 0.0098) were also associated with poorer outcomes
      after recurrence. Of the 648 patients, 124 showed no progression, 196 developed
      another local recurrence, 178 developed in-transit/lymph node metastases, and 150
      had systemic recurrences. Survival was only 33.6% for patients with further
      metastases, compared with 77.4% for patients with no progression of disease after
      a median follow-up of 38.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: There was a 48.5% mortality rate 
      at 5 years of follow-up after local recurrence. Long term survival (> 10 years)
      was estimated to be 34.9%. The patterns of failure after local recurrence suggest
      that patients may benefit from aggressive locoregional therapy.

TI  - Investigation of the use of the CAMCOG in the visually impaired elderly.
PG  - 863-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of decreased visual acuity due to cataract on 
      tests of cognitive function in the elderly. METHOD: Patients at a precataract
      surgery assessment clinic were screened to exclude cognitive impairment. The
      CAMCOG was completed by 42 subjects, and the visual acuity for each eye assessed.
      RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between visual acuity and the CAMCOG
      score, which was abolished when simple modifications were made to the CAMCOG.
      Although 5 subjects scored below the cut-off point, 3 with worse visual acuity
      scored within the cut-off. CONCLUSIONS: Visual impairment has a significant
      effect on the scoring of the CAMCOG. However, the effect may not only be due to
      decreased visual acuity but also to other factors such as contrast sensitivity,
      which may be affected by cataract.

TI  - C.A.R.E.: an approach for teaching ethics in medicine.
PG  - 1563-7
AB  - Various societal factors have contributed to an increase in the ethical dilemmas 
      faced by physicians, yet limited formal training in ethical decision-making is
      provided for those practitioners during their medical education. The pluralistic 
      nature of contemporary medicine seems amenable to the development of common
      clinical and educational approaches to ethical dilemmas. The authors propose one 
      such framework--a four question approach called C.A.R.E.--that encourages
      physicians at all levels of training to acknowledge individual and collective
      factors that enter into ethical decision-making. These questions are clearly
      described, and examples for use of the model in teaching settings are also
      provided. The authors believe that this approach can have significant utility in 
      medical education and clinical settings, and advocate for its use and evaluation.

TI  - Six-month clinical and angiographic outcome after successful excimer laser
      angioplasty for in-stent restenosis.
PG  - 69-74
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the clinical and angiographic six-month
      follow-up after excimer laser coronary angioplasty (ELCA) for restenosed coronary
      stents. BACKGROUND: Excimer laser coronary angioplasty has recently been shown to
      be safe and efficient for the treatment of in-stent restenosis. METHODS:
      Ninety-six consecutive patients successfully treated with ELCA within 141 stents 
      were included in a six-month clinical and angiographic follow-up. RESULTS: During
      follow-up there was one sudden death and one patient with documented myocardial
      infarction. Angina pectoris classified as > or = Canadian Cardiovascular Society 
      II reoccurred in 49 patients. Follow-up angiography was obtained in 89 patients
      (93%) with 133 stents. Quantitative coronary angiography revealed a mean diameter
      stenosis of 77 +/- 10% before intervention, 41 +/- 12% after laser treatment and 
      11% +/- 12% after adjunctive percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (p < 
      0.001). Six months after ELCA the mean diameter stenosis had increased to 60 +/- 
      26% (p < 0.001). A > or =50% diameter stenosis was present in 48 patients (54%); 
      in 24 of these patients diameter stenosis was > or =70%. Total occlusions
      occurred in an additional 10 patients (11%). There was a trend toward an
      increased recurrent restenosis rate in patients with diabetes mellitus and long
      lesions or total occlusions (p = 0.059). Forty-eight patients (50%) received
      medical treatment after six months. Reinterventions were necessary in 30 patients
      (31%), and coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in 17 patients (18%).
      Event-free survival was 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Excimer laser angioplasty for in-stent 
      restenosis was associated with a high incidence of recurrent restenosis in this
      group of patients, suggesting that this technique is unlikely to reduce recurrent
      in-stent restenosis and that other approaches are necessary.

TI  - Lamina propria lymphocytes, not macrophages, express CCR5 and CXCR4 and are the
      likely target cell for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the intestinal
      mucosa.
PG  - 785-91
AB  - Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections are acquired via
      mucosal surfaces, and transmitted viruses are nearly always macrophage-tropic,
      suggesting that mucosal macrophages participate in early HIV-1 infection. Mucosal
      lymphocytes isolated from normal human intestine expressed CD4 (14,530+/-7970
      antibody-binding sites [ABSs]/cell), CCR5 (2730+/-1524 ABSs/cell), and CXCR4
      (2507+/-1840 ABSs/cell), but intestinal macrophages, which also expressed CD4
      (2959+/-2695 ABSs/cell), displayed no detectable CCR5 or CXCR4 ABS. The absence
      of CCR5 on intestinal macrophages was not due to expression of the Delta32
      deletion allele because matched-blood monocytes expressed CCR5. CCR5(+)CXCR4(+)
      intestinal lymphocytes supported both R5 (BaL) and X4 (IIIB) HIV-1 replication,
      whereas the CCR5(-)CXCR4(-) macrophages were not permissive to either isolate or 
      other laboratory isolates (ADA and DJV) and primary isolates (MDR 24 and JOEL).
      In the intestinal mucosa, lymphocytes, not macrophages, are the likely target
      cell for R5 (and X4) HIV-1 and are the major source of HIV-1 production during
      early infection.

TI  - Femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe
      reimplantation response after lung transplantation.
PG  - 559-61
AB  - Severe pulmonary reimplantation response after lung transplantation is not very
      common, although the mortality can be high. We present a patient who developed an
      extremely severe reperfusion injury after bilateral lung transplantation. Because
      of severe hypoxia and hemodynamic instability, despite aggressive ventilator
      settings, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was instituted 
      using the femoral approach at the bedside. During ECMO, the patient developed a
      thoracic wall hematoma that was treated with transfusion alone. After 50 h of
      ECMO, his chest radiograph had dramatically improved, his oxygen need had been
      reduced to 50%, and he was successfully weaned from ECMO. Two years later, he is 
      doing extremely well. Therefore, institution of ECMO using the femoral approach
      can be performed safely at the bedside in the ICU, and can be lifesaving in the
      context of a very severe reimplantation response after lung transplantation.

TI  - Structural abnormalities of subicular dendrites in subjects with schizophrenia
      and mood disorders: preliminary findings.
PG  - 349-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postmortem studies of the subiculum from subjects with schizophrenia 
      have detected smaller pyramidal cell bodies and diminished immunoreactivity for
      the dendritic protein, microtubule-associated protein 2. While these findings
      suggest that subicular pyramidal cell dendrites may be structurally altered in
      subjects with schizophrenia, this possibility had not been tested directly.
      METHODS: Rapid Golgi impregnation of archival brain specimens was used to compare
      the morphologic characteristics of subicular dendrites in subjects with
      schizophrenia (n = 13) and mood disorders (n = 6) with subjects without
      psychiatric disease (n = 8). The specimens were processed and analyzed by
      physicians blind to diagnosis. The extent of dendritic trees in the subiculum and
      fusiform gyrus was examined by Sholl analysis. Spine density on apical dendrites 
      of subicular pyramidal cells was determined at a fixed distance from the cell
      body. RESULTS: Spine density and arborization of subicular apical dendrites were 
      significantly related to diagnostic group. Spine density was significantly lower 
      in the schizophrenia and mood disorder groups than in the nonpsychiatric group.
      Among the mood disorder cases, diminished spine density was apparently related to
      a strong family history of major psychiatric diseases. There were no significant 
      effects of diagnostic group on Sholl analysis of nonapical subicular dendrites
      nor on Sholl analysis of dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in the fusiform
      gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: We have observed an association between schizophrenia and
      major mood disorders and structural abnormalities of subicular apical dendrites. 
      Further studies are needed to test this association in a larger sample and to
      evaluate the potential role of family history and of confounding factors, such as
      medications and chronic institutionalization.

TI  - Differences in in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome between white and black women
      in an inner-city, university-based IVF program.
PG  - 1170-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare IVF outcomes between white and black women in an
      inner-city, university-based IVF program. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING:
      University-based IVF program. PATIENT(S): Ninety-five white women undergoing 121 
      cycles and 37 black women undergoing 47 cycles. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Implantation rate and pregnancy rate (PR). RESULT(S): Black
      women constituted 28. 0% of the population and underwent 28.0% of the total
      cycles. There were no statistically significant differences in age, basal FSH,
      number of ampules, duration of stimulation, endometrial thickness, P on the day
      of hCG, cancellation rate, number of oocytes, or embryos transferred. However,
      the duration of infertility, body mass index (BMI), incidence of tubal-factor
      infertility, and peak E(2) levels were significantly higher in black women. In
      addition, a larger proportion of black women required aggressive stimulation than
      white women (70.2% and 43.0%). Both implantation rates and clinical PRs were
      significantly lower in black women than in white women (9.8% and 19.2% compared
      with 23.4% and 42.2%, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Black women have poorer IVF
      outcomes than white women. These differences can be partly explained by higher
      BMI, longer duration of infertility, higher incidence of tubal-factor
      infertility, and higher peak E(2).

TI  - Sutural expansion osteogenesis for management of the bony-tissue defect in cleft 
      palate repair: experimental studies in dogs.
PG  - 2012-25; discussion 2026-7
AB  - A series of experimental studies on sutural expansion osteogenesis for management
      of the bony-tissue defect in cleft palate repair was performed between 1995 and
      1997. Forty-five young dogs in weaning were used in four experiments that were
      divided into two parts. Part I probed the possibility of closing the surgically
      constructed hard palate cleft not only with mucoperiosteum but also with bony
      tissue by the technique of sutural expansion of lateral palatine sutures. Part II
      explored the possibility of pushing the palatine bone posteriorly and advancing
      the maxillary segment anteriorly by transverse palatine suture expansion. In Part
      I, a ring-shaped suture expander made of nickel-titanium shape memory alloy was
      used to expand the lateral suture of palatine bones. Expansion forces of 200 G,
      360 G, and 480 G were used for the first experiment. A force of 360 G was chosen 
      for two other experiments; this force is equivalent to the distraction rate of
      0.5 mm per day of a jackscrew device. The ring-shaped suture expander was opened 
      and its two feet were fixed in the medial sides of residual horizontal plates of 
      the palatine bones immediately after a hard palate cleft was constructed
      surgically under endotracheal general anesthesia. At the eighth postoperative
      day, under the traction of 360 G, the two sides of the 8-mm-wide hard palate
      cleft were brought into contact with each other, and 8 or 9 days later the closed
      palatal cleft had healed completely with mucosal tissue. This experiment was
      repeated twice and yielded the same results. Sutural expansion osteogenesis was
      evaluated physically, fluorescently, histologically, and ultrastructurally to
      examine the deposition of the regenerated bone in the suture areas. Additionally,
      the influence of sutural expansion osteogenesis of the palatal bones on other
      facial bones was also studied cephalometrically. In Part II, a bow-shaped suture 
      expander made of nickel-titanium shape memory alloy was applied to expand either 
      the left or the right side of the transverse palatal suture of each of the
      experimental dogs. At the postoperative week 4 to 6, the maxillary segment was
      moved forward 5 to 6 mm on the expanded side, and the palatal bone was pushed
      backward 5 mm. The changes of bone position were assessed radiographically and
      cephalometrically. Tissue response of circum-maxillary sutures was examined
      histologically. These experiments led to the following conclusions: (1) Bony
      closure of the surgically constructed hard palate cleft with a ring-shaped suture
      expander made of nickel-titanium shape memory alloy is possible. (2) Anterior
      advancement of the maxillary segment and posterior lengthening of the hard palate
      using a bow-shaped suture expander made of nickel-titanium shape memory alloy
      applied at the palatomaxillary suture (transverse palatal suture) of the hard
      palate are also possible. Thus, in humans, a new approach for cleft palate repair
      may be a worthwhile investigation.

TI  - Myocardial stunning after streptokinase: what is the significance of the Q wave?
PG  - E11
AB  - A 58 year old woman presented with symptoms and electrocardiographic features
      consistent with acute infero-posterior myocardial infarction. The attempt at
      reperfusion with aspirin and thrombolytic treatment was deemed unsuccessful in
      view of Q wave development on ECG, a 48 hour period of hypotension and oliguria, 
      and extensive wall motion abnormality on echocardiography. This was at variance
      with findings of a minimal cardiac enzyme rise. On the seventh day, list mode
      acquired, ECG gated, cineimages of perfusion and blood pool demonstrated
      strikingly normal perfusion despite continued contractile dysfunction. Six weeks 
      later ECG, echocardiography, and radionuclide blood pool ventriculography had all
      normalised consistent with resolution of myocardial stunning. This practical
      method for the diagnosis of stunning, the significance of the ECG changes in
      particular the development of Q waves, and the time taken to resolution of this
      phenomenon are discussed.

TI  - Reactive psychoses revisited.
PG  - 458-67
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: This paper describes the overlap between reactive
      (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the
      gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from
      international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive
      psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and
      modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. RESULTS:
      Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on 
      occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response
      to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset
      and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks.
      Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social
      isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement 
      and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive
      psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability
      in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising
      experiences, occasionally operating in combination. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing
      failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it
      removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an
      integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup,
      social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of
      the links between psychosis and our common humanity.

TI  - IL-8 is an angiogenic factor in human coronary atherectomy tissue.
PG  - 1519-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a CXC chemokine that induces the migration and 
      proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, is a potent
      angiogenic factor that may play a role in atherosclerosis. Previously, IL-8 has
      been reported in atherosclerotic lesions and circulating macrophages from
      patients with atherosclerosis. Therefore, we sought to determine whether IL-8
      plays a role in mediating angiogenic activity in atherosclerosis. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: Homogenates from 16 patients undergoing directional coronary atherectomy
      (DCA) and control samples from the internal mammary artery (IMA) of 7 patients
      undergoing bypass graft surgery were assessed for IL-8 content by specific ELISA,
      immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for IL-8 mRNA. The contribution
      of IL-8 to net angiogenic activity was assessed using the rat cornea micropocket 
      assay and cultured cells. IL-8 expression was significantly elevated in DCA
      samples compared with IMA samples (1.71+/-0.6 versus 0.05+/-0.03 ng/mg of total
      protein; P<0.01). Positive immunolocalization of IL-8 was found exclusively in
      DCA tissue sections, and it correlated with the presence of factor VIII-related
      antigen. In situ reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed the
      expression of IL-8 mRNA in DCA tissue. Corneal neovascular response, defined by
      ingrowth of capillary sprouts toward the implant, was markedly positive with DCA 
      pellets, but no constitutive vessel ingrowth was seen with IMA specimens.
      Neutralizing IL-8 attenuated both the in vivo corneal neovascular response and
      the in vitro proliferation of cultured cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest
      that, in human coronary atherosclerosis, IL-8 is an important mediator of
      angiogenesis and may contribute to plaque formation via its angiogenic
      properties.

TI  - Immune reaction against the cytoskeleton in coeliac disease.
PG  - 520-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cytoskeleton actin network of intestinal microvilli has been
      found to be rapidly impaired after gluten challenge in coeliac disease (CD). The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the presence of an immune reaction towards
      cytoskeleton structures such as actin filaments in CD. METHODS: Eighty three
      antiendomysial antibody positive CD patients (52 children and 31 adults) were
      studied at our outpatient clinics from 1996 to 1998 using indirect
      immunofluorescence, ELISA, and western blotting for antiactin (AAA) and
      antitissue transglutaminase (TGA) antibodies before and after a gluten free diet 
      (GFD). Sixteen patients with smooth muscle antibody positive autoimmune
      hepatitis, 21 with inflammatory bowel diseases, seven with small bowel bacterial 
      overgrowth, and 60 healthy subjects were studied as controls. RESULTS: Fifty nine
      of 83 CD patients (28/31 adults (90.3%); 31/52 children (59.6%)) were positive
      for IgA and/or IgG AAA. Seventy seven (92.7%) were positive for IgA TGA. IgA AAA 
      were strongly correlated with more severe degrees of intestinal villous atrophy
      (p<0.0001; relative risk 86.17). After a GFD, AAA became undetectable within five
      months. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the immune reaction against the extracellular
      matrix, we have described an immune reaction against the cytoskeleton in both
      children and adults with CD. As AAA are strongly associated with more severe
      degrees of villous atrophy, they may represent a useful serological marker of
      severe intestinal atrophy in CD.

TI  - A prospective study of seeding of the skin after core biopsy of the breast.
PG  - 104-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of core biopsies done for breast abnormalities is
      increasing. The risk of skin seeding resulting from core biopsy is unknown.
      METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with breast cancer were studied. The skin
      and subcutaneous fat surrounding the site of core needle penetration were excised
      and studied by routine histologic staining. Findings were correlated with other
      clinical variables. RESULTS: Eighty-nine consecutive patients were studied.
      Thirty-one had stereotactic core biopsies, 23 had vacuum-assisted biopsy, 8 had
      multiple-puncture biopsy, and 58 had ultrasound-guided core biopsy. Two patients 
      who were biopsied using multiple-puncture biopsy were found to have nests of
      cancer cells in the dermis. One of these patients had recurrence in the skin
      biopsy site at 34 months. CONCLUSION: Skin seeding may be important in light of
      increasing use of image-directed biopsy, and particularly for cases in which the 
      biopsy puncture site is outside the index quadrant and in which no radiation is
      anticipated.

TI  - Racial differences in endothelin-1 at rest and in response to acute stress in
      adolescent males.
PG  - 722-5
AB  - Blacks exhibit greater vasoconstriction-mediated blood pressure (BP) increases in
      response to stress than do whites. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictive
      peptide, has been proposed as having a role in racial differences in stress
      reactivity. We evaluated the hemodynamic and plasma ET-1 levels of 41 (23 whites,
      18 blacks, mean age 18.6 years) normotensive adolescent males at rest and in
      response to a video game challenge and forehead cold stimulation. Measurements
      were performed at catheter insertion and before and immediately after the 2
      stressors, which were separated by 20-minute rest periods. Blacks exhibited
      higher absolute levels of diastolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance
      index, or both in response to catheter insertion and to the video game challenge 
      and during recovery from video game challenge and cold stimulation (P<0. 05 for
      all). Blacks exhibited higher absolute levels of ET-1 at every evaluation point
      (P<0.05 for all) and greater increases in ET-1 in response to both stressors
      (ps<0.05). These findings suggest that altered endothelial function may be
      involved in racial differences in hemodynamic reactivity to stress and possibly
      in the development of essential hypertension.

TI  - Cognitive dysfunction in obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 281-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of cognitive functions among obsessive-compulsive disorder 
      (OCD) patients would help in understanding the neurobiology and brain areas
      involved in that disorder. The objective of this work was to study the cognitive 
      dysfunction in OCD patients and to identify its correlation with both the
      clinical picture and the severity of the disorder. METHOD: Neuropsychological and
      electrophysiological event-related potentials were tested in 30 OCD patients and 
      compared with 30 normal volunteers of a matched gender, age and education.
      RESULTS: Results showed a defective visuospatial recognition, which worsens with 
      chronicity, deteriorated set-shifting abilities, overfocused attention to
      irrelevant stimuli and delayed selective attention to relevant tasks. Mild cases 
      showed better selective attention than severe cases. Obsessive cases had a
      defective visual memory, while compulsive cases had delayed perception of task
      relevant stimuli. Mixed cases showed disturbed information-processing both early 
      and late. CONCLUSION: OCD patients have a characteristic pattern of cognitive
      dysfunction that differs among patients of varied severity, chronicity and
      symptom type. We suggest a striatofrontoparietal neural pathophysiology. OCD
      seems to be a heterogeneous disorder, both clinically and pathophysiologically.

TI  - A multicenter trial with a somatostatin analog (99m)Tc depreotide in the
      evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules.
PG  - 1232-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The affinity of various malignant neoplasms including small cell and
      non-small cell lung cancer for peptide analogs of somatostatin has been well
      documented. Depreotide is such an analog and can be complexed with technetium-99m
      ((99m)Tc depreotide) for optimal imaging properties. Using this
      radiopharmaceutical, solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) were previously evaluated
      in a successful phase II/III trial. The results of the larger multicenter phase
      III study using (99m)Tc depreotide to differentiate malignant and benign
      etiologies in SPN are now presented. METHODS: Patients with SPN </= 6 cm on chest
      radiograph were referred for evaluation. One hundred fourteen individuals who had
      an absence of a benign pattern of calcification on CT scan, age > 30 years, and
      no demonstrable radiographic stability for the prior 2 years were studied. All
      underwent single-photon emission CT (SPECT) with (99m)Tc depreotide and
      subsequent tissue histologic examination. Three nuclear medicine specialists
      blinded to histologic findings examined the SPECT images and scored them as
      positive or negative based on the presence or absence of activity in the
      radiographic region of the SPN. The final result was determined by the majority
      score, which was then compared with the histologic result. RESULTS: Of the 114
      individuals studied, 88 had a histologic result compatible with malignant
      neoplasm. (99m)Tc depreotide scintigraphy correctly identified 85 of this group, 
      with three false-negative determinations compared with histology. There were
      seven false-positive determinations, including six granulomas and one hamartoma. 
      (99m)Tc depreotide scintigraphy correctly excluded malignancy in 19 of 26
      patients with benign histologic findings. The sensitivity of this method was
      96.6% with a specificity of 73.1%. CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc depreotide scintigraphy is
      a safe and useful method for the noninvasive evaluation of SPN with a sensitivity
      and accuracy comparable to that reported for fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose
      positron emission tomography.

TI  - Outcome indicators for stroke: application of an algorithm treatment across the
      continuum of postacute rehabilitation services.
PG  - 1468-78
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and utility of applying a case-mix
      adjusted algorithm for treatment across the continuum of stroke rehabilitation.
      DESIGN: Implementation of a clinical algorithm developed through national expert 
      panels to standardize rehabilitation assessment and treatment of veterans with
      stroke. Stroke patients were stratified into initial severity groups using FIM
      instrument-Function Related Groups (FIM-FRG) classifications and were followed up
      from first rehabilitation referral to completion of all active restorative
      functional goals. FIM-FRG assignments were used to establish case-mix adjusted
      outcome indicators for the continuum of rehabilitation services. SETTING:
      Rehabilitation services in medical and surgical units, intermediate care units,
      inpatient rehabilitation bed units, and outpatient settings in 10 participating
      Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. PATIENTS: Stroke patients (n = 421) who
      received rehabilitation in the 10 participating VA centers. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Patients' functional gains, length of treatment (LOT), functional
      status at discharge, LOT efficiency, costs, cost efficiency, and disposition
      location. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-three patients began rehabilitation while
      in acute medical or surgical units, 171 in inpatient rehabilitation units, 24 in 
      intermediate care, and the remainder while in other settings. With cases compiled
      across all settings, average total rehabilitation costs for patients in the
      lowest FRG class (most severe disabilities) were more than twice those for
      patients assigned to the highest FRG class (least severe disabilities). FIM gains
      were greatest in the subset of younger stroke patients with the most severe
      disabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a standard algorithm of rehabilitation
      care that includes outcome indicators adjusted to patients' disability severity
      is feasible. The algorithm's utility is evident because it encompasses
      rehabilitation care provided across the full continuum, promotes access to care
      by advocating assessment of all stroke patients, encourages early initiation of
      treatment, and promotes a smooth transition though various levels of care while
      encouraging cost containment.

TI  - Lung cancer screening results in the National Cancer Institute New York study.
PG  - 2356-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports of radiologically occult early stage lung
      carcinomas detected by sputum cytology suggested that screening by cytology might
      lead to earlier diagnosis, more effective surgical therapy, and lower death rates
      from lung carcinoma. Thus, a randomized study was undertaken to evaluate sputum
      cytology as a lung carcinoma screening technique supplementing the chest X-ray.
      METHODS: Three major medical centers participated in the study, recruiting
      approximately 10,000 cigarette smoking men older than 45 years of age at each
      center: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York, NY, Johns
      Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, MD, and The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. At
      MSKCC, the men were divided randomly into two groups: a dual screen group
      received four monthly sputum cytology examinations in addition to annual
      posteroanterior and lateral chest X-rays and an X-ray only group received annual 
      chest X-rays but no sputum examinations. The men suspected of lung carcinoma
      because of radiologic or sputum cytology findings were referred immediately for
      evaluation, and those with operable lung carcinoma were recommended for surgery
      and treated with intent to cure. RESULTS: The men who entered into the study
      remained in the screening program for 5- 8 years, depending on their date of
      enrollment, and were followed for 2 years after screening. Follow-up was
      completed on more than 99%. There were 53 of the 10,040 men in the study who were
      found to have lung carcinoma on initial examination (prevalence): 23 were in the 
      X-ray only group; of 30 found in the dual screen group, 9 (all with squamous cell
      carcinoma) were detected by cytology alone. During the entire study and the
      2-year follow-up period, 354 of the 10,040 men developed lung carcinoma, equally 
      divided between the dual screen and X-ray only groups. Nearly two-thirds (190
      men) had lesions that were detected by screening, and over 50% (100 men) were in 
      Stage I. Excluding oat cell carcinoma, during the screening period 175 of 250
      carcinomas (70%) were detected by screening. In contrast, during the 2-year
      post-screening period, 61 lung carcinomas were diagnosed of which only 12 (20%)
      were Stage I. Chest X-ray was most effective in detecting peripheral
      adenocarcinomas of the lung, which were the most common cell type. Cytology was
      most effective in detecting early epidermoid carcinomas of major bronchi. The
      epidermoid carcinomas grew slowly, metastasized late, and after becoming visible 
      by X-ray could be treated equally effectively as in the earlier occult stage.
      Forty percent of all the lung carcinomas were detected in Stage I, and at least
      two-thirds of the patients with Stage I lung carcinoma treated by complete
      resection did not die of their disease. Overall 5-year survival of all patients
      with lung carcinoma who had enrolled in the detection program was 35%, compared
      with 13% for the United States as a whole during this same time period.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sputum cytology and the chest X-ray complemented each other as lung 
      carcinoma detection techniques. The chest X-ray best detected peripheral
      adenocarcinomas of the lung, which are the most common type of lung carcinoma.
      Sputum cytology detected epidermoid carcinomas arising in major bronchi, but
      these are slow growing tumors that can be resected and cured after becoming
      visible by chest X-ray. Thus, for subjects at risk of lung carcinoma who could be
      followed by annual chest X-rays, sputum cytology did not improve survival, but
      for high risk subjects who had only a single screening examination, sputum
      cytology increased the number of early lung carcinomas detected. The design of
      the current study did not permit evaluation of chest X-ray screening versus
      nonscreening for prevention of death from lung carcinoma. However, the large
      proportion of Stage I lung carcinomas and the high survival rate of patients in
      this study compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data
      strongly suggested that screening for lung carcinoma in high risk populations is 
      a valuable public health measure.

TI  - Opposite effects of amlodipine and enalapril on infarct collagen and remodelling 
      during healing after reperfused myocardial infarction.
PG  - 617-25
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine
      versus the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril with or without
      reperfusion on infarct collagen and remodelling during healing after anterior
      myocardial infarction (MI). ANIMALS AND METHODS: In vivo left ventricular (LV)
      remodelling and function (by quantitative echocardiography) and hemodynamics were
      measured over six weeks in dogs that were randomized 24 h after reperfusion (2 h 
      after anterior MI) or no reperfusion to oral amlodipine (5 mg bid, n=6),
      enalapril (5 mg bid, n=6), placebo (bid, n=6) or sham surgery (n=6) for six
      weeks. Ex vivo infarct size, infarct collagen (hydroxyproline), collagen volume
      fraction and LV topography were measured at six weeks. RESULTS: Compared with
      placebo controls without reperfusion over six weeks in vivo, enalapril or
      amlodipine with or without reperfusion produced LV unloading and preserved
      volumes, shape and function, but enalapril limited LV hypertrophy more than
      amlodipine. However, compared with no reperfusion, amlodipine preserved infarct
      wall thickness and shape while enalapril decreased infarct wall thickness and
      increased the shape index. Ex vivo at six weeks, scar size as a percentage of
      risk was similar in the MI groups. Importantly, enalapril decreased infarct
      collagen already lowered by reperfusion, while amlodipine preserved infarct
      collagen after reperfusion and increased collagen volume fraction in spared
      myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of infarct collagen limits infarct
      remodelling during healing after reperfused MI and preserves LV shape. Amlodipine
      and enalapril exert opposite effects on infarct collagen and remodelling after
      reperfused MI.

TI  - Staged radiosurgical treatment for large benign cerebral lesions.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - OBJECT: Large brain lesions are considered unamenable to gamma knife treatment
      because of possible adverse effects. The proximity of eloquent brain to a target 
      location, including some arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), still poses a
      challenge to the neurosurgeon. Because meningiomas and AVMs often show a slow or 
      absent growth rate, partial radiosurgical treatment in cases with risk of
      unacceptable surgery-related morbidity is an alternative. The authors evaluated
      the results of staged treatment. METHODS: Since April 1992, 12 patients suffering
      from large benign tumors (meningiomas) and seven with AVMs considered inoperable 
      underwent gamma knife radiosurgery in staged procedures. All patients with tumors
      underwent primary open surgery for partial removal of recurrent growth and
      subsequent radiosurgical treatment. Four men and eight women ranging in age from 
      26 to 73 years harbored tumors that ranged in volume from 19 to 90 cm3. Marginal 
      dose ranged from 10 to 25 Gy prescribed in the 30 to 50% isodose. The time
      interval between the radiosurgical treatments varied from 1 to 8 months. Follow
      up ranged from 5 and 89 months. Three female and four male patients (age range
      10-48 years) had undergone previous AVM embolization and were treated with margin
      doses of 18 to 22 Gy in the 40 to 50% isodose. The volume range of these AVMs was
      11 to 25 cm3. The time interval between radiosurgical treatments ranged from 5 to
      36 months. The mean follow up was 22.6 months. Neurological follow-up
      examinations showed clinical improvement in 11 patients (58%), whereas five (26%)
      remained unchanged. Among tumor patients no deterioration or further tumor growth
      was observed. Tumor necrosis demonstrated noticed in five patients (26%). One
      patient with an AVM suffered from seizures and hemiparesis. Follow-up magnetic
      resonance imaging of the residual nidus disclosed no rebleeding. CONCLUSIONS: For
      selected patients with large benign lesions staged gamma knife radiosurgery could
      be an alternative, as evidenced by the authors' series in which there was no
      mortality and low incidence morbidity.

TI  - Analysis of therapeutic and immunologic effects of R(24) anti-GD3 monoclonal
      antibody in 37 patients with metastatic melanoma.
PG  - 2693-702
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antitumor effects of antibodies against ganglioside antigens of
      melanoma have been reported, but neither optimal doses nor mechanisms have been
      established. METHODS: This Phase IB trial of the murine immunoglobulin IgG(3)
      monoclonal antibody R(24) against disialoganglioside GD3 was conducted with 37
      patients to define better the dose-response relation and mechanism of action of
      R(24) in patients with metastatic melanoma. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity
      consisted of a pulmonary capillary leak syndrome in 3 of 5 patients in the 80
      mg/M(2)/day dosage tier. Serial blood and tumor biopsy samples were obtained
      prior to therapy and on Days 5, 9, and 22 following R(24) infusion. Tumor
      biopsy-infiltrating lymphocytes were enumerated in peritumoral, endotumoral, and 
      perivascular compartments: endotumoral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and HLA-DR(+) T 
      cells increased over time on R(24) antibody. Endotumoral CD4 lymphoid infiltrate 
      activation (DR expression) and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity were the greatest 
      in the one patient who achieved a complete response. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical
      response was associated with depression in natural killer (CD56(+) and
      CD56(+)DR(+)) blood cells (P = 0.03) and was associated with R(24) dosage (P =
      0.01). A complete response that lasted 2 years and a partial response that lasted
      2 months occurred at a dose of 1 mg/M(2)/day. The limited number of clinical
      responses observed in this trial hampered the correlation of antitumor and immune
      parameters but provided a rational foundation for the future evaluation of
      antiganglioside antibodies.

TI  - Treatment of patients with recurrent and primary refractory acute myelogenous
      leukemia using mitoxantrone and intermediate-dose cytarabine: a pharmacologically
      based regimen.
PG  - 2037-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although chemotherapy can achieve a high rate of disease remission
      induction in patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),
      patients with recurrent or refractory AML generally have a poorer rate of
      response. This study assessed the utility of mitoxantrone and intermediate-dose
      cytarabine (Ara-C) in the treatment of patients with recurrent or refractory AML.
      METHODS: Forty-seven patients with recurrent or refractory AML were treated with 
      Ara-C, 0.5 gm/m2, intravenously (i.v.) every 12 hours x 12 doses on Days 1-6 and 
      mitoxantrone, 5 mg/m2, i.v. on Days 1-5. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of the 47 patients 
      (62%) achieved a complete response. The median duration of disease remission was 
      112 days (range, 29 days- 8 years). Of the 25 patients age > or = 60 years, 19
      (76%) had a complete disease remission and the median duration of disease
      remission in this group was 114 days (range, 33-370 days), although all patients 
      subsequently developed a disease recurrence. The chemotherapy generally was well 
      tolerated, with a mean duration of neutropenia of 31 days and a mean duration of 
      thrombocytopenia of 33 days. Three patients died of infectious complications
      between 23-26 days after the initiation of chemotherapy, 1 patient died of sudden
      cardiac arrest 13 days after the initiation of chemotherapy, and 1 patient
      developed cutaneous desquamation. Three patients developed acute cerebellar
      dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mitoxantrone and Ara-C is effective in the
      treatment of patients with recurrent and refractory AML. The subgroup of patients
      age > or = 60 years also had a high rate of disease remission induction with this
      regimen, and the regimen generally was well tolerated.

TI  - Toward elimination of Haemophilus influenzae type B carriage and disease among
      high-risk American Indian children.
PG  - 1550-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This report describes the epidemiology of Haemophilus influenzae type
      b (Hib) invasive disease and oropharyngeal colonization among Navajo and White
      Mountain Apache children younger than 7 years in an era of widespread
      immunization. METHODS: We conducted active surveillance for invasive H influenzae
      disease from 1992 to 1999 and an oropharyngeal carriage study from 1997 to 1999. 
      The predominant vaccine used was PedvaxHib. RESULTS: The average annual incidence
      of invasive Hib disease among children younger than 24 months was 22 cases per
      100,000. Of 381 children younger than 7 years, only 1 (0.3%; 95% confidence
      interval = 0.0%, 1.3%) was colonized with Hib; 370 (97%) had received 2 or more
      doses of Hib conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Among Navajo and White Mountain
      Apache children, Hib conjugate vaccines have led to a sustained reduction in
      invasive Hib disease and a reduction in oropharyngeal Hib carriage. The disease
      incidence among children younger than 24 months remains 20 times higher than in
      the general US population. Hib elimination will require additional
      characterization of colonization and disease in these high-risk populations.

TI  - Predicting outcome of defibrillation by spectral characterization and
      nonparametric classification of ventricular fibrillation in patients with
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
PG  - 1523-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 156 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of cardiac cause,
      we analyzed the ability of 4 spectral features of ventricular fibrillation before
      a total of 868 shocks to discriminate or not between segments that correspond to 
      return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). METHODS AND RESULTS: Centroid
      frequency, peak power frequency, spectral flatness, and energy were studied. A
      second decorrelated feature set was generated with the coefficients of the
      principal component analysis transformation of the original feature set. Each
      feature set was split into training and testing sets for improved reliability in 
      the evaluation of nonparametric classifiers for each possible feature
      combination. The combination of centroid frequency and peak power frequency
      achieved a mean+/-SD sensitivity of 92+/-2% and specificity of 27+/-2% in
      testing. The highest performing classifier corresponded to the combination of the
      2 dominant decorrelated spectral features with sensitivity and specificity equal 
      to 92+/-2% and 42+/-1% in testing or a positive predictive value of 0.15 and a
      negative predictive value of 0.98. Using the highest performing classifier, 328
      of 781 shocks not leading to ROSC would have been avoided, whereas 7 of 87 shocks
      leading to ROSC would not have been administered. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG contained 
      information predictive of shock therapy. This could reduce the delivery of
      unsuccessful shocks and thereby the duration of unnecessary "hands-off" intervals
      during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The low specificity and positive predictive
      value indicate that other features should be added to improve performance.

TI  - Cognitive approach to depression and suicidal thinking in psychosis. 2. Testing
      the validity of a social ranking model.
PG  - 522-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: In paper I we reported that depression in the acute stage remitted in
      line with the psychosis and that 36% of patients developed post-psychotic
      depression (PPD). AIMS: We apply our cognitive framework to PPD and chart the
      appraisal of self and psychosis and their link with the later emergence of PPD.
      METHOD: Patients with ICD-10 schizophrenia (n=105) were followed up over 12
      months following the acute episode, taking measures of depression, working
      self-concept, cognitive vulnerability, insight and appraisals of psychosis.
      RESULTS: Before developing PPD, these patients felt greater loss, humiliation and
      entrapment by their illness than those who relapsed or did not become depressed, 
      and were more likely to see their future selves in 'lower status' roles. Upon
      becoming depressed, participants developed greater insight, lower self-esteem and
      a worsening of their appraisals of psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Depression in
      psychosis arises from the individual's appraisal of psychosis and its
      implications for his/her perceived social identity, position and 'group fit'.
      Patients developing PPD feel forced to accept a subordinate role without
      opportunity for escape. Implications for treatment are discussed.

TI  - Transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening for stroke prevention in sickle cell anemia:
      pitfalls in technique variation.
PG  - 733-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) identified
      children as being at high stroke risk if the time-averaged maximum mean velocity 
      (TAMMV) of the middle cerebral or intracranial internal carotid arteries measured
      > or = 200 cm/s. These values were obtained utilizing a 2-mHz dedicated
      nonimaging pulsed Doppler technique (TCD) and manual measurements. Questions have
      been raised as to the comparability of results obtained with different ultrasound
      machines and measurement techniques. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      compare nonimaging (TCD) and transcranial duplex imaging (TCDI) findings in
      children potentially at risk for stroke with sickle cell disease. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Twenty-two children with sickle cell disease and no history of stroke
      were evaluated by both TCD and TCDI. Examinations were performed on the same day 
      without knowledge of the other modality results and read independently using
      manually obtained measurements. Mean velocities, peak systolic velocities, and
      end diastolic velocities obtained by the two techniques were compared. In a
      subgroup, manual measurements were compared to electronically obtained
      measurements. RESULTS: TCDI values were lower than TCD measurements for all
      vessels. TCDI TAMMV values were most similar to the TCD values in the middle
      cerebral artery (-9.0%) and distal internal cerebral artery (-10.8%), with
      greater variability in the anterior cerebral artery (-19.3%), bifurcation
      (-16.3%), and basilar arteries (-23.1%). Risk group placement based on middle
      cerebral artery TAMMV values did not change when comparing the two techniques.
      Measurements obtained electronically were lower than those obtained manually.
      CONCLUSION: Velocities obtained by TCDI may be lower than TCD measurements, and
      these differences should be taken into consideration when performing screening
      for stroke risk and selection for prophylactic transfusion based on the STOP
      protocol.

TI  - Role of naloxone in newborn resuscitation.
PG  - 831-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because of questions about the basis for the use of naloxone in
      resuscitation of the newborn, we wished to evaluate the use of naloxone at our
      institution and an affiliated hospital. METHODOLOGY: Evaluation of the actual use
      of naloxone at a university hospital and a community hospital: we document
      naloxone use by daily survey for a month in one; in the other, we perform a
      retrospective record review of 1 year's use. RESULTS: The university hospital had
      240 births during February, 1998. Naloxone was given twice: once, 7 minutes
      before delivery to a woman at term who had received opiates about 2 hours
      previously; and once, intramuscularly, to a premature infant for apnea, before
      being intubated. The community hospital had 2044 births during fiscal 1998.
      Twenty-six neonates were identified as having received naloxone. Of the 26, 13
      received naloxone without needing ventilatory support; all 13 with respiratory
      depression had a predisposing perinatal complication. CONCLUSION: The use of
      naloxone in practice may not conform to the American Academy of Pediatrics'
      guidelines for use in resuscitation of the newborn. The use of naloxone in
      resuscitation of the newborn should be reevaluated.

TI  - Phantom limb pain treated with therapeutic touch: a case report.
PG  - 522-4
AB  - Phantom limb pain is a widespread condition that responds poorly to conventional 
      medical and surgical treatments. A case report is presented of the successful
      treatment of phantom leg pain in a 62-year-old man with peripheral vascular
      disease using the complementary medical technique of Therapeutic Touch. The
      clinical and research literature of Therapeutic Touch is briefly reviewed, with
      regard to subjective outcome measures like pain and anxiety, as well as to
      several objective measures of physiologic function. The possible role of
      nonspecific factors like placebo responsiveness or hypnotic dissociation in this 
      case are considered, as are the applicability of complementary and alternative
      medicine to phantom limb pain, the neurologic mechanisms that generate phantom
      sensations, and the possible mechanism of action of Therapeutic Touch.

TI  - Regional lymphadenopathy in cat-scratch disease: ultrasonographic findings.
PG  - 640-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cat-scratch disease (CSD) is considered to be an emerging disease
      worldwide and is caused by Bartonella henselae, a gram-negative bacterium
      introduced by a scratch or bite of a cat. The most common clinical manifestation 
      is regional lymphadenopathy, but clinical recognition may be difficult, as
      atypical manifestations may occur. The diagnosis is confirmed with serologic
      testing and histology is rarely needed. This paper is based on our experience
      with the use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of CSD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of
      this study was to describe the sonographic and color Doppler appearances of
      regional lymphadenopathy in CSD, as this has not widely reported in the
      literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients (average 9.4 years) were 
      included who all had serologically and/or histologically proven CSD and had been 
      studied using US early in the clinical course. All had a positive history of
      exposure to cats and exhibited regional lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: US showed large
      hypoechoic adenopathy with some transmission enhancement and high vascularization
      on color-flow Doppler imaging. In 30 patients, abdominal US was also performed
      and splenic and/or hepatic granulomata were found in 10. CONCLUSIONS: In our
      experience, sonography and especially color-Doppler and power-Doppler sonography 
      was helpful in the diagnosis of CSD. We believe it should be used in the initial 
      study of children with regional lymphadenopathy, and serologic testing should be 
      performed when CSD is suspected.

TI  - Reversion of prion protein conformational changes by synthetic beta-sheet breaker
      peptides.
PG  - 192-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are associated with a
      structural transition in the prion protein that results in the conversion of the 
      physiological PrPc to pathological PrP(Sc). We investigated whether this
      conformational transition can be inhibited and reversed by peptides homologous to
      the PrP fragments implicated in the abnormal folding, which contain specific
      residues acting as beta-sheet blockers (beta-sheet breaker peptides). METHODS: We
      studied the effect of a 13-residue beta-sheet breaker peptide (iPrP13) on the
      reversion of the abnormal structure and properties of PrP(Sc) purified from the
      brains of mice with experimental scrapie and from human beings affected by
      sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In a cellular model of familial
      prion disease, we studied the effect of the peptide in the production of the
      abnormal form of PrP in intact cells. The influence of the peptide on prion
      infectivity was studied in vivo by incubation time assays in mice with
      experimental scrapie. FINDINGS: The beta-sheet breaker peptide partly reversed
      in-vitro PrP(Sc) to a biochemical and structural state similar to that of PrPc.
      The effect of the peptide was also detected in intact cells. Treatment of prion
      infectious material with iPrP13 delayed the appearance of clinical symptoms and
      decreased infectivity by 90-95% in mice with experimental scrapie.
      INTERPRETATION: Beta-sheet breaker peptides reverse PrP conformational changes
      implicated in the pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathies. These peptides or 
      their derivatives provide a useful tool to study the role of PrP conformation and
      might represent a novel therapeutic approach for prion-related disorders.

TI  - Glucose and insulin metabolism are important determinants of left ventricular
      mass in obese hypertensives.
PG  - 1103-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and hypertension, the major modifiable clinical determinants 
      of left ventricular mass, are both associated with a state of insulin resistance.
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between glucose and insulin metabolism 
      and left ventricular mass in a group of obese, nondiabetic, hypertensive people. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two obese, nondiabetic, hypertensive people (10
      men), free of coronary or valvular heart disease, with normal left ventricular
      function were studied. The mean age was 55+/-12 years, body mass index 32.8+/-4.8
      kg/m2, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures 149.0+/-11.0 mmHg and
      98.0+/-4.0 mmHg, respectively. Left ventricular mass corrected for height
      (LVM/Ht) and glucose and insulin metabolism (3 h intravenous glucose tolerance
      test) were measured after a four- to six-week washout period of any
      antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: The mean LVM/Ht was 119.5+/-11.9 kg/m. The 
      following metabolic measures correlated with LVM/Ht in a univariate analysis:
      total insulin integration area (r=0.54, P=0.008); fasting insulin (r=0.43,
      P=0.04); insulin at 90 min (r=0.54, P=0.013); and peak glucose levels (r=0.51,
      P=0.013). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis showed that only total
      insulin integration area (P=0.005) and peak glucose levels (P=0.01) correlated
      with LVM/Ht. CONCLUSION: In obese, nondiabetic, hypertensive people, left
      ventricular mass is associated with circulating glucose and insulin levels.

TI  - Bayesian communication: a clinically significant paradigm for electronic
      publication.
PG  - 254-66
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a model for Bayesian communication to enable readers to
      make reported data more relevant by including their prior knowledge and values.
      BACKGROUND: To change their practice, clinicians need good evidence, yet they
      also need to make new technology applicable to their local knowledge and
      circumstances. Availability of the Web has the potential for greatly affecting
      the scientific communication process between research and clinician. Going beyond
      format changes and hyperlinking, Bayesian communication enables readers to make
      reported data more relevant by including their prior knowledge and values. This
      paper addresses the needs and implications for Bayesian communication.
      FORMULATION: Literature review and development of specifications from readers',
      authors', publishers', and computers' perspectives consistent with formal
      requirements for Bayesian reasoning. RESULTS: Seventeen specifications were
      developed, which included eight for readers (express prior knowledge, view effect
      size and variability, express threshold, make inferences, view explanation,
      evaluate study and statistical quality, synthesize multiple studies, and view
      prior beliefs of the community), three for authors (protect the author's
      investment, publish enough information, make authoring easy), three for
      publishers (limit liability, scale up, and establish a business model), and two
      for computers (incorporate into reading process, use familiar interface
      metaphors). A sample client-only prototype is available at
      http://omie.med.jhmi.edu/bayes. CONCLUSION: Bayesian communication has formal
      justification consistent with the needs of readers and can best be implemented in
      an online environment. Much research must be done to establish whether the
      formalism and the reality of readers' needs can meet.

TI  - Combining sulfonylureas and other oral agents.
PG  - 15S-22S
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive disorder, and although oral monotherapy
      is often initially successful, it is associated with a high secondary failure
      rate, which contributes to the development of long-term diabetes complications
      resulting from persistent hyperglycemia. For patients not taking insulin,
      accumulating evidence suggests that combination therapy using oral antidiabetic
      agents with different mechanisms of action may be highly effective in achieving
      and maintaining target blood glucose levels. Low-dose combination therapy may be 
      associated with fewer side effects than higher-dose monotherapy and may achieve
      similar or better glycemic control. The best-studied combination is that of
      sulfonylurea compounds plus metformin, a therapeutic approach that addresses both
      underlying defects in the disorder: insulin deficiency and insulin resistance.
      Other multidrug regimens under investigation are sulfonylurea compounds plus
      either alpha-glucosidase inhibitors or thiazolidinediones, and combinations of
      various insulin-sensitizing agents. For many patients, combination oral therapy
      may be used appropriately as primary management early in the course of type 2
      diabetes, along with diet modification and exercise. Later in the course of the
      disease, the use of combinations of oral agents may delay the need for insulin
      while maintaining glycemic control, thus making aggressive oral treatment more
      acceptable for many patients.

TI  - Hospital and physician volume or specialization and outcomes in cancer treatment:
      importance in quality of cancer care.
PG  - 2327-40
AB  - PURPOSE: To conduct a comprehensive review of the health services literature to
      search for evidence that hospital or physician volume or specialty affects the
      outcome of cancer care. METHODS: We reviewed the 1988 to 1999 MEDLINE literature 
      that considered the hypothesis that higher volume or specialization equals better
      outcome in processes or outcomes of cancer treatments. RESULTS: An extensive,
      consistent literature that supported a volume-outcome relationship was found for 
      cancers treated with technologically complex surgical procedures, eg, most
      intra-abdominal and lung cancers. These studies predominantly measured
      in-hospital or 30-day mortality and used the hospital as the unit of analysis.
      For cancer primarily treated with low-risk surgery, there were fewer studies. An 
      association with hospital and surgeon volume in colon cancer varied with the
      volume threshold. For breast cancer, British studies found that physician
      specialty and volume were associated with improved long-term outcomes, and the
      single American report showed an association between hospital volume of initial
      surgery and better 5-year survival. Studies of nonsurgical cancers, principally
      lymphomas and testicular cancer, were few but consistently showed better
      long-term outcomes associated with larger hospital volume or specialty focus.
      Studies in recurrent or metastatic cancer were absent. Across studies, the
      absolute benefit from care at high-volume centers exceeds the benefit from
      break-through treatments. CONCLUSION: Although these reports are all
      retrospective, rely on registries with dated data, rarely have predefined
      hypotheses, and may have publication and self-interest biases, most support a
      positive volume-outcome relationship in initial cancer treatment. Given the
      public fear of cancer, its well-defined first identification, and the
      tumor-node-metastasis taxonomy, actual cancer care should and can be
      prospectively measured, assessed, and benchmarked. The literature suggests that, 
      for all forms of cancer, efforts to concentrate its initial care would be
      appropriate.

      care patients.
PG  - 153-62
AB  - We describe a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial conducted at
      seven primary care clinics of a Seattle area HMO. Adults with major depression
      (n=290) beginning antidepressant treatment completed structured interviews at
      baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Interviews examined clinical
      outcomes (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and depression module of the
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IIIR), employment status, and work days
      missed due to illness. Medical comorbidity was assessed using computerized
      pharmacy data, and medical costs were assessed using the HMO's computerized
      accounting data. Using data from the 12-month assessment, patients were
      classified as remitted (41%), improved but not remitted (47%), and persistently
      depressed (12%). After adjustment for depression severity and medical comorbidity
      at baseline, patients with greater clinical improvement were more likely to
      maintain paid employment (P=.007) and reported fewer days missed from work due to
      illness (P<.001). Patients with better 12-month clinical outcomes had marginally 
      lower health care costs during the second year of follow-up (P=.06). We conclude 
      that recovery from depression is associated with significant reductions in work
      disability and possible reductions in health care costs. Although observational
      data cannot definitively prove any causal relationships, these longitudinal
      results strengthen previous findings regarding the economic burden of depression 
      on employers and health insurers.

TI  - Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging in children with recurrent
      primary brain tumors.
PG  - 1020-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ((1)H-MRSI) is a
      noninvasive technique for spatial characterization of biochemical markers in
      tissues. We measured the relative tumor concentrations of these biochemical
      markers in children with recurrent brain tumors and evaluated their potential
      prognostic significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: (1)H-MRSI was performed on 27
      children with recurrent primary brain tumors referred to our institution for
      investigational drug trials. Diagnoses included high-grade glioma (n = 10),
      brainstem glioma (n = 7), medulloblastoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor (n =
      6), ependymoma (n = 3), and pineal germinoma (n = 1). (1)H-MRSI was performed on 
      1. 5-T magnetic resonance imagers before treatment. The concentrations of choline
      (Cho) and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the tumor and normal brain were quantified 
      using a multislice multivoxel method, and the maximum Cho:NAA ratio was
      determined for each patient's tumor. RESULTS: The maximum Cho:NAA ratio ranged
      from 1.1 to 13.2 (median, 4.5); the Cho:NAA ratio in areas of normal-appearing
      brain tissue was less than 1.0. The maximum Cho:NAA ratio for each histologic
      subtype varied considerably; approximately equal numbers of patients within each 
      tumor type had maximum Cho:NAA ratios above and below the median. Patients with a
      maximum Cho:NAA ratio greater than 4.5 had a median survival of 22 weeks, and all
      13 patients died by 63 weeks. Patients with a Cho:NAA ratio less than or equal to
      4.5 had a projected survival of more than 50% at 63 weeks. The difference was
      statistically significant (P =.0067, log-rank test). CONCLUSION: The maximum
      tumor Cho:NAA ratio seems to be predictive of outcome in children with recurrent 
      primary brain tumors and should be evaluated as a prognostic indicator in newly
      diagnosed childhood brain tumors.

TI  - Genetic abnormalities in mammary ductal intraepithelial neoplasia-flat type
      ("clinging ductal carcinoma in situ"): a simulator of normal mammary epithelium.
PG  - 2072-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mammary ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN)-flat type ("clinging
      ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]") generally is a subtle epithelial alteration
      characterized by one or a few layer(s) of atypical cells replacing the native
      epithelium. The "low power" appearance of DIN-flat type can be misinterpreted
      easily as "normal" because of the frequent absence of multilayered proliferation 
      and often subtle cytologic atypia. Because it presents as an often unrecognized
      lesion or in association with tubular carcinoma, to the authors' knowledge the
      clinical and biologic significance of this lesion has not been well established. 
      METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction, the authors examined DNA extracts from 
      microdissected areas of 22 cases with extensive "clinging DCIS," including 13
      cases associated with infiltrating ductal carcinoma as well as 5 cases associated
      with more conventional types of DCIS. Eight polymorphic DNA markers with a high
      rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in classic types of DCIS were selected to
      identify possible genetic alterations on chromosomes 2p, 3p, 11q, 16q, and 17q.
      Two cases also were used for the assessment of clonality by means of X chromosome
      inactivation (methylation pattern of the human androgen receptor [HUMARA] gene). 
      RESULTS: LOH was detected in 17 of 22 lesions (77%), and monoclonality was
      established in the 2 cases analyzed. The most common genetic alterations were at 
      chromosomes 11q21-23.2, 16q23.1-24.2, and 3p14.2 with LOH in 50%, 45%, and 41%,
      respectively, of informative cases. The DIN-flat type showed the same genetic
      alterations (LOH) identified in adjacent in situ and infiltrating ductal
      carcinoma. In contrast to the DIN-flat type, the perfectly normal mammary
      epithelium was associated very infrequently (1 of 16 cases; 6%) with LOH.
      CONCLUSIONS: The DIN-flat type represents one of the earliest, morphologically
      recognizable, neoplastic alterations of the breast. Recognition of the DIN-flat
      type is important not only for the early detection of intraductal neoplasia but
      also to prevent misinterpretation and utilization of this lesion as a normal
      control in studies. This distinctive lesion could be crucial as an explanation
      for at least part of the > 20% reported incidence rate of breast carcinoma
      recurrence observed despite ostensibly "negative" margins of breast biopsies.

TI  - Identification of in-hospital complications from claims data. Is it valid?
PG  - 785-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the validity of the Complications Screening
      Program (CSP) by testing whether (1) ICD-9-CM codes used to identify a
      complication are coded completely and accurately and (2) the CSP algorithm
      successfully separates conditions present on admission from those occurring in
      the hospital. METHODS: We compared diagnosis and procedure codes contained in the
      Medicare claim with codes abstracted from an independent re-review of more than
      1,200 medical records from Connecticut and California. RESULTS: Eighty-nine
      percent of the surgical cases and 84% of the medical cases had their CSP trigger 
      codes corroborated by re-review of the medical record. For 13% of the surgical
      cases and 58% of the medical cases, the condition represented by the code was
      judged to be present on admission rather than occurring in-hospital. The positive
      predictive value of the claim was greater than 80% for the surgical risk pool,
      suggesting the value of the CSP as a screening tool. CONCLUSIONS: The CSP has
      validity as a screen for most surgical complications but only for 1 medical
      complication. The CSP does not have validity as a "stand-alone" tool to identify 
      more than a few in-hospital surgery-related events. The addition of an indicator 
      to the Medicare claim to capture the timing of secondary diagnoses would improve 
      the validity of the CSP for identifying both surgical and medical in-hospital
      events.

TI  - Treatment of floating knee injuries through a single percutaneous approach.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - The current study is a review of 20 patients treated by percutaneous
      stabilization for a floating knee. All patients were treated with a retrograde
      femoral intramedullary nail and a small diameter tibial intramedullary nail
      through a 4-cm medial parapatellar tendon incision. The average Injury Severity
      Score was 19. Two patients died in the early postoperative period and one patient
      was lost to followup. The average time to union for the 17 remaining patients
      with femoral shaft fractures was 14.7 weeks. One patient required dynamization.
      Four of the 17 patients with tibia fractures required an exchange nailing
      procedure, one with bone graft, to achieve union. One patient required
      dynamization and one patient with bone loss required only a bone graft. The
      average time to union for the tibia fractures was 23 weeks. One patient achieved 
      115 degrees knee flexion and the remaining 15 patients had full knee motion by 12
      weeks, which they were able to maintain. No patient had signs or symptoms of knee
      pain. This demanding surgical technique using a small incision has yielded good
      clinical results. Although it is an excellent treatment option for patients with 
      ipsilateral femoral and tibial shaft fractures, the mortality and tibial fracture
      complication rates remain high.

TI  - Cigarette smoking and suicide: a prospective study of 300,000 male active-duty
      Army soldiers.
PG  - 1060-3
AB  - The authors examined the relation between cigarette smoking and suicide by
      conducting a cohort study of 300,000 male US Army personnel followed
      prospectively from January 1987 through December 1996 for 961,657 person-years.
      They found that the risk of suicide increased significantly with the number of
      cigarettes smoked daily (p for trend < 0.001). In multivariable-adjusted
      analyses, smokers of more than 20 cigarettes a day, compared with never smokers, 
      were more than twice as likely to commit suicide. For male active-duty army
      personnel, the dose-related association between smoking and suicide was not
      entirely explained by the greater tendency of smokers to be White, drink heavily,
      have less education, and exercise less often.

TI  - Ribavirin inhibits West Nile virus replication and cytopathic effect in neural
      cells.
PG  - 1214-7
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen that was reported
      for the first time in the Western hemisphere in August 1999, when an encephalitis
      outbreak in New York City resulted in 62 clinical cases and 7 deaths. WNV, for
      which no antiviral therapy has been described, was recently recovered from a pool
      of mosquitoes collected in New York City. In anticipation of the recurrence of
      WNV during the summer of 2000, an analysis was made of the efficacy of the
      nucleoside analogue ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral compound with activity 
      against several RNA viruses, for treatment of WNV infection. High doses of
      ribavirin were found to inhibit WNV replication and cytopathogenicity in human
      neural cells in vitro.

TI  - Mucolytics for bronchiectasis.
PG  - CD001289
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiectasis is usually characterised by the production of large
      quantities of sputum that patients frequently have difficulty in expectorating.
      Mucolytic agents target hyper-secretion or changed physiochemical properties of
      sputum to make it easier to clear. One drug, recombinant human DNase, breaks down
      the DNA that is released at the site of infection by neutrophils. OBJECTIVES: The
      objective of this review was to assess the effects of ingested or inhaled
      mucolytics in patients with bronchiectasis. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the
      Cochrane Airways Group trials register, reference lists of relevant articles. We 
      also contacted experts in the field and drug companies. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomised trials of mucolytic treatment in people with bronchiectasis but not
      cystic fibrosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction was performed
      independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted for confirmation.
      MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were included. In one study, compared to placebo, high
      doses of bromhexine combined with antibiotics eased difficulty in expectoration
      (weighted mean difference -0.53, 95% confidence interval -0.81 to -0.25 at 16
      days). There was also a reduction in sputum production with bromhexine (weighted 
      mean difference -21.5%, 95% confidence interval -38.9 to -4.1 at day 16). There
      was no difference in forced expiratory volume. In a second study, compared to
      placebo, recombinant human DNase showed no difference in forced expiratory volume
      or forced vital capacity. Adverse effects, including influenza-like symptoms,
      were more common in the group receiving recombinant human DNase. REVIEWER'S
      CONCLUSIONS: There is not enough evidence to evaluate the routine use of
      mucolytics for bronchiectasis. High doses of bromhexine coupled with antibiotics 
      may help with sputum production and clearance.

TI  - Prediction of detached personality in healthy subjects by low dopamine
      transporter binding.
PG  - 290-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low striatal dopamine D(2) receptor binding in healthy human subjects 
      has been associated with detached personality in studies using positron emission 
      tomography (PET) and the Karolinska Scales of Personality questionnaire. The
      authors investigated whether a similar correlation exists between striatal
      dopamine transporter binding and detached personality. METHOD: Eighteen healthy
      volunteers participated in a PET study with the specific dopamine transporter
      ligand [(18)F]CFT ([(18)F]WIN 35,428) and completed the Karolinska Scales of
      Personality questionnaire form. RESULTS: Age-corrected dopamine transporter
      binding in the putamen, but not in the caudate, correlated negatively with
      detachment personality scores, especially in the right hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS:
      This finding supports the hypothesis that low dopaminergic neurotransmission is
      associated with detached personality. Furthermore, since [(18)F]CFT binding is
      thought to reflect the density of dopaminergic nerve terminals in the brain, the 
      authors suggest that the neurodevelopmental formation of the brain dopaminergic
      system may influence adult personality traits.

TI  - Effect of renal artery stenting on renal function and size in patients with
      atherosclerotic renovascular disease.
PG  - 1671-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal artery stenting is widely performed, but little is known about 
      its effectiveness in preserving renal function and size in patients with
      renovascular disease and chronic renal insufficiency. We studied the effect of
      renal artery stenting on renal function and size in patients with obstructive
      renovascular disease and chronic renal insufficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS: Stent 
      deployment was performed in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine
      >1.5 mg. dL(-1)) and global renovascular obstruction (bilateral renal artery
      stenosis or unilateral stenosis in the presence of a solitary or single
      functional kidney). The effect of renal artery stenting on renal function was
      assessed by comparing the slopes of the regression lines derived from the
      reciprocal of serum creatinine versus time plotted before and after stent
      deployment. Renal size was assessed by serial ultrasound of pole-to-pole kidney
      length. Stenting was successful in all 61 vessels in 33 patients. Twenty-five
      patients had complete follow-up (mean 20+/-11 months). Before stent deployment,
      all patients exhibited a negative slope, indicating progressive renal
      insufficiency. After stent deployment, the slopes were positive in 18 and less
      negative in 7 patients. Thus, the mean slope increased from -0.0079 to 0.0043 dL.
      mg(-1). mo(-1) (P:<0.001). Ultrasonography on 41 kidneys revealed preservation of
      size, with the kidney length measuring 10.4+/-1.4 cm at baseline and 10.4+/-1.1
      cm at last follow-up (P:=NS). Patient survival at 20+/-11 months was 90%.
      CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and global obstructive 
      atherosclerotic renovascular disease, renal artery stenting improves or
      stabilizes renal function and preserves kidney size.

TI  - Pretreatment assessment of prognostic indicators in endometrial cancer.
PG  - 1535-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The object of this study was to assess the association of histologic, 
      cytokinetic, and molecular variables in preoperative endometrial samples with
      extrauterine disease, recurrence, and survival among patients with endometrial
      cancer. STUDY DESIGN: In a case-cohort study of 125 women, ploidy, S-phase
      fraction, proliferative index, deoxyribonucleic acid index, proliferating cell
      nuclear antigen, MIB-1 proliferation marker, p53 tumor suppressor gene, and
      cytoplasmic HER-2/neu oncogene and bcl-2 expressions were quantitated. RESULTS: A
      model with only one independent term predicted progression-free survival; that
      variable was p53 (P <. 0001; relative risk, 5.60). A model with two independent
      terms predicted disease-related survival; these variables were p53 (P =. 0002;
      relative risk, 7.39) and MIB-1 (P =.03; relative risk, 3.27). Among patients with
      tumors with both p53 and MIB-1 expression exceeding 33%, a total of 32% had died 
      of disease by 2 years. A model for predicting extrauterine disease selected two
      independent variables: p53 (odds ratio, 3.20; P =.01) and ploidy (odds ratio, 2. 
      16; P =.04). An advanced surgical stage was encountered in 26% to 35% of cases in
      which either the p53 expression exceeded 33% or the deoxyribonucleic acid content
      was nondiploid and in 53% of cases in which both variables were unfavorable.
      CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative evaluation of quantifiable cytokinetic and molecular
      variables can assist in identifying tumor types that are predisposed toward a
      more aggressive clinical course.

AB  - AIMS: To compare the American Diabetes Association (ADA) fasting criteria and
      World Health Organization (WHO) 2-h criteria for diabetes in an urban south
      Indian population. METHODS: Subjects were drawn from the Chennai Urban Population
      Study. Of the 1001 subjects studied, 52 (5.2%) were diagnosed as having diabetes 
      according to WHO 2-h criteria and 32 (3.2%) according to the ADA fasting
      criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-five (48%) of the subjects diagnosed with diabetes by
      the WHO 2-h criteria were not classified as having diabetes by the ADA fasting
      criteria. Similarly, of the 78 subjects (7.8%) classified as having impaired
      glucose tolerance (IGT), only eight (10.3%) had impaired fasting glucose (IFG)
      according to the ADA fasting criteria. The overall agreement between the WHO 2-h 
      criteria and ADA fasting criteria was poor (kappa = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: Use of
      the ADA fasting criteria results in a lower prevalence rates of diabetes in this 
      lean urban south Indian population.

TI  - Youth mental health promotion in the Hunter region.
PG  - 579-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the work of the Hunter Institute of Mental Health, with
      special emphasis on its role in mental health promotion and prevention with
      adolescents. METHOD AND RESULTS: The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion is used 
      as a framework to describe the varied functions of this organisation. Four youth 
      mental health promotion programs are given as examples of the Institute's work.
      Results of preliminary evaluation of the Youth Suicide Prevention - National
      University Curriculum Project are provided. CONCLUSION: The Hunter Institute of
      Mental Health, a self-funding unit of the Hunter Area Health Service, provides
      innovative health promotion programs as part of its role as a provider of mental 
      health education and training. The model may be particularly applicable to mental
      health services in regional Australia.

TI  - Hospitalisation for RSV infection in ex-preterm infants-implications for use of
      RSV immune globulin.
PG  - 122-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) specific immune globulin is now
      being marketed for prevention of RSV infection in ex-preterm infants. However,
      there are no published UK data on the morbidity or mortality from RSV in these
      infants. AIMS: To determine the morbidity and mortality from RSV infection in a
      cohort of infants previously treated at a regional neonatal unit, and compare the
      cost of hospitalisation for RSV with the potential cost of administering RSV
      immune globulin (RSV-IG) prophylaxis. METHODS: Infants born at a gestation of
      less than 32 weeks were studied. Details of admissions for respiratory illness in
      the first two years of life were collected from hospital records, referring
      hospitals, and general practitioners. RESULTS: Data on 82 infants were collected.
      Up to three RSV seasons were encountered. The hospitalisation rate for confirmed 
      RSV infection for the first season encountered was 4%. Rates of ward and
      paediatric intensive care unit admission were higher for infants with chronic
      lung disease. There were no deaths from RSV. RSV-IG would not have been cost
      effective for most infants. CONCLUSION: The morbidity and mortality rates from
      RSV observed in this group do not support the widespread introduction of RSV-IG
      prophylaxis for ex-preterm infants.

TI  - Antibiotics for acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
PG  - CD001211
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are concerns regarding whether antibiotic therapy confers
      significant benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to assess the benefit and harm of
      antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group specialised register,
      the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register - Central, MEDLINE and the reference
      lists of identified trial reports. We used the Science Citation Index to look for
      articles that cited the relevant studies, and we contacted investigators and
      pharmaceutical companies for information about additional trials. The most recent
      searches were carried out in September 1998. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included
      double masked randomised controlled trials in which any form of antibiotic
      treatment had been compared with placebo in the management of acute bacterial
      conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example,
      antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic usage. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One
      reviewer extracted data and the accuracy was checked by a second reviewer.
      Relative risks were summarised. We tested for heterogeneity between studies. MAIN
      RESULTS: Six published trials were identified of which three fulfilled the
      eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. One trial was single masked
      and therefore excluded. A second report, when translated, was found to have no
      placebo group and was therefore excluded. One trial is currently 'awaiting
      assessment'. This has been published in abstract form and has yet to be fully
      reported. All the trials thus far identified appear to have been conducted on a
      selected specialist care patient population. The trials were heterogeneous in
      terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, 
      and the outcome measures assessed. Meta-analysis indicates that acute bacterial
      conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition, as clinical remission
      (cure or significant improvement) occurred by days two to five in 64% (95%
      confidence interval (CI) 57% to 71%) of those treated with placebo. Treatment
      with antibiotics was, however, associated with significantly better rates of
      clinical remission (days two to five: relative risk (RR) 1.31 95% CI 1.11 to
      1.55, NNT=5) with a suggestion that this benefit was maintained for late clinical
      remission (days six to 10: RR 1.27 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61, NNT=5). Antibiotic
      treatment was associated with rates of microbiological remission (pathogen
      eradication or reduction). No serious outcomes were reported in either the active
      or placebo arms of these trials, indicating that important sight-threatening
      complications are an infrequent occurrence. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Acute
      bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently a self-limiting condition but the use of
      antibiotics is associated with significantly improved rates of early clinical
      remission and early and late microbiological remission. Since trials to-date have
      been conducted in selected specialist care patient populations these results may 
      not necessarily be generalisable to a primary care based population. A trial
      based in primary care designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of commonly
      prescribed antibiotic(s) versus placebo in acute bacterial conjunctivitis is
      warranted.

TI  - Long term outcome of unilateral pallidotomy: follow up of 15 patients for 3
      years.
PG  - 337-44
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With the advent of new antiparkinsonian drug therapy and promising
      results from subthalamic and pallidal stimulation, this study evaluated the long 
      term efficacy of unilateral pallidotomy, a technique which has gained popularity 
      over the past decade for the management of advanced Parkinson's disease. METHODS:
      The 15 patients reported here are part of the original cohort of 24 patients who 
      underwent posteroventral pallidotomy for motor fluctuations and disabling
      dyskinesias 3 years ago as part of a prospective study. Evaluation scales
      included the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale, the Goetz dyskinesia
      scale, and the Purdue pegboard test. RESULTS: When compared with the
      prepallidotomy scores, the reduction in the limb dyskinesias and off state tremor
      scores persisted on the side contralateral to pallidotomy at the end of 3 years
      (dyskinesias were reduced by 64% (p<0.01) and tremor by 63% (p<0.05). Other
      measures tended to deteriorate. The dosage of antiparkinsonian medications did
      not change significantly from 3 months prepallidotomy to 3 years postpallidotomy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although unilateral pallidotomy is useful in controlling the
      contralateral dyskinesias and tremor 3 years after surgery, all other early
      benefits disappear and activities of daily living continue to worsen.

TI  - Telephone medicine for internists.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - The role of the telephone in medical practice is important, but often
      problematic. Mistakes in telephone diagnosis and triage can have severe
      consequences. An effective office system can reduce liability risks, and in some 
      cases telephone contact can substitute for office visits. Internists feel
      unprepared to provide telephone care. Therefore, residency education needs to
      focus on documentation, consultant availability, and performance feedback.
      Research should focus on improving outcomes, reimbursement issues, and
      technologic advances. This article describes internists' telephone interactions
      with ambulatory patients, preparation for telephone medicine, and aspects of
      office telephone systems and makes comparisons with other primary care fields.

PG  - 721-32
AB  - This study examines factors that contribute to depressive symptoms and to
      co-occurring depression, substance abuse, and conduct problems among 602 runaway 
      and homeless adolescents. The respondents were interviewed in shelters, drop-in
      centers, and directly on the streets in four Midwestern states (Missouri, Iowa,
      Nebraska, and Kansas). Results indicate that although family-of-origin factors
      contribute to depressive symptoms and comorbidity among runaway and homeless
      adolescents, experiences and behaviors when the adolescents are on their own also
      have powerful effects. The authors discuss the findings from a life-course
      perspective focusing on mechanisms through which street experiences accentuate or
      amplify already high levels of psychological distress and behavioral problems
      among this population of young people.

TI  - Insulin-induced decrease in large artery stiffness is impaired in uncomplicated
      type 1 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1043-8
AB  - Normal insulin action in vivo involves a decrease in stiffness of large arteries 
      (a decrease in aortic pressure augmentation). We determined whether the ability
      of insulin to decrease arterial stiffness is altered in uncomplicated type 1
      diabetes. Nine type 1 diabetic men (age 28+/-2 years, body mass index 24+/-1
      kg/m(2)) and 9 matched normal men were studied under normoglycemic
      hyperinsulinemic (sequential 2-hour insulin infusions of 1 [step 1] and 2 [step
      2] mU x kg(-1) x min(-1)) conditions. Central aortic pressure waveforms were
      synthesized from those recorded in periphery with applanation tonometry on the
      radial artery and a validated reverse transfer function to construct the central 
      aortic pressure wave every 30 minutes. This allowed the determination of aortic
      augmentation (the pressure difference between the first and the second systolic
      peaks) and the augmentation index (augmentation divided by pulse pressure), as
      the measure of stiffness of large arteries. Whole-body glucose uptake was 44%
      (step 1) and 37% (step 2) lower (P<0.001) in the diabetic patients than in the
      normal subjects. At baseline, before the insulin infusion, augmentation averaged 
      0+/-1 and 2+/-1 mm Hg (NS) and the augmentation index was -1.5+/-4.5% and
      4.0+/-3.7% (NS) in the normal and diabetic subjects, respectively. After 1 hour
      of hyperinsulinemia, the augmentation index had decreased significantly (P<0.01) 
      to -9.5+/-4.8% in the normal subjects but remained at 4.4+/-4.2% in the diabetic 
      patients. A significant decrease was not observed in the diabetic patients until 
      150 minutes (-1.2+/-4.1%, P<0.05 versus baseline). Whole-body glucose uptake was 
      significantly inversely correlated with the change in the augmentation index
      during step 1 (r=-0.61, P<0.01). Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes involves a
      defect in the ability of insulin to decrease central aortic pressure. This defect
      could predispose these patients to premature stiffening of large arteries.

TI  - Pharmacological interventions for spasticity following spinal cord injury.
PG  - CD001131
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spasticity is a major health problem for patients with a spinal cord 
      injury (SCI) that limits patients' mobility and affects independence in
      activities of daily living and work. Spasticity may also cause pain, loss of
      range of motion, contractures, sleep disorders and impair ambulation in patients 
      with an incomplete lesion. The effectiveness of available drugs is still
      uncertain and they may cause adverse effects. Assessing what works in this area
      is complicated by the lack of valid and reliable measurement tools. The aim of
      this systematic review is to critically appraise and summarise existing
      information of the effectiveness of available treatments and to identify areas
      where further research is needed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and
      safety of Baclofen, Dantrolene, Tizanidine and any other drugs for the treatment 
      of long term spasticity in SCI patients as well as the effectiveness and safety
      of different routes of administration of Baclofen. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched
      the Injuries Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register,
      MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINHALH up to 1998. Drug companies and experts active in the 
      area were also contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: All parallel and crossover RCTs
      including spinal cord injury patients complaining of "severe spasticity". Studies
      where less than 50% of patients had a spinal cord injury were excluded. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Methodological quality of studies (allocation
      concealment, blinding, patients characteristics, inclusion and exclusion
      criteria; interventions; outcomes; lost to follow up) was independently assessed 
      by two investigators. The heterogeneity among studies did not allow quantitative 
      combination of results. MAIN RESULTS: Nine out of 53 studies met the inclusion
      criteria. Study design was: 8 cross over, 1 parallel-group trial. Two studies (14
      SCI patients), showed a significant effect of intrathecal baclofen in reducing
      spasticity (Ashworth Score and ADL performances), compared to placebo, without
      any side effect. The study comparing tizanidine to placebo (118 SCI patients)
      showed a significant effect of tizanidine in improving Ashworth Score but not in 
      ADL performances. Tizanidine group reported significant rates of adverse effects 
      (drowsiness, xerostomia). For the other drugs (Gabapentine, Clonidine, Diazepam, 
      Amytal and oral Baclofen ) the results do not provide evidence for a clinical
      significant effectiveness. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence
      to assist clinicians in a rational approach to antispastic treatment for SCI.
      Further research is urgently needed to improve the scientific basis of patient
      care.

TI  - Treatment of Eaton stage I trapeziometacarpal disease with thumb metacarpal
      extension osteotomy.
PG  - 1100-6
AB  - The current benchmark for the treatment of Eaton stage I disease of the
      trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joint includes palmar oblique ligament reconstruction
      and reflects its primary role in providing stability during lateral pinch. This
      study prospectively evaluates the efficacy of an alternative extra-articular
      approach using a 30 degrees extension osteotomy of the thumb metacarpal to
      redistribute trapeziometacarpal contact area and load, obviating the need for
      ligament reconstruction. Preoperative and postoperative subjective and objective 
      data are reported for 12 patients enrolled in the study between 1995 and 1998.
      Trapeziometacarpal arthrotomy allowed accurate intra-articular assessment and
      verified palmar oblique ligament incompetence in each case. The average follow-up
      period was 2.1 years (range, 6-46 months). All osteotomies healed at an average
      of 7 weeks. Eleven patients were satisfied with outcome. Grip and pinch strength 
      increased an average of 8.5 and 3.0 kg, respectively. Thumb metacarpal extension 
      osteotomy is an effective biomechanical alternative to ligament reconstruction in
      the treatment of Eaton stage I disease of the trapeziometacarpal joint.

TI  - A new approach to blood pressure measurement in the primary care setting.
PG  - 725-6
AB  - In this study, a method of taking one blood pressure reading using a
      sphygmomanometer was compared with a method of taking multiple successive
      readings using an automatic device. With multiple readings the blood pressure
      tended to be lower and fewer patients were classified as hypertensive. Using an
      automatic blood pressure recording device seems to be a practical way of
      achieving multiple readings in a busy clinic setting.

TI  - Unstable angina during pregnancy in two patients with premature coronary
      atherosclerosis and aortic stenosis in association with familial
      hypercholesterolemia.
PG  - 1152-5
AB  - Obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is uncommon in women during
      childbearing age, and the occurrence of myocardial ischemia during pregnancy has 
      therefore been anecdotal. Two young patients with premature coronary artery
      disease in association with familial hypercholestrolemia had unstable angina in
      the second trimester of pregnancy. Workup revealed coronary artery disease and
      aortic stenosis. One patient opted for abortion at the twentieth week of
      gestation, and the other decided to continue pregnancy and was delivered by
      cesarean at 28 weeks' gestation. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed
      after pregnancy in both patients. In addition, one of the patients underwent
      aortic valve replacement, and other had replacement of the narrowed ascending
      aorta with uneventful recovery. Our report describes an uncommon presentation of 
      unstable angina during pregnancy in 2 young women with premature coronary artery 
      disease and aortic valvular and supravalvular stenosis as a result of familial
      hypercholesterolemia. The management of these conditions during pregnancy is
      influenced by the effects of available therapeutic modalities on both maternal
      and fetal outcome.

TI  - Candidemia in allogeneic blood and marrow transplant recipients: evolution of
      risk factors after the adoption of prophylactic fluconazole.
PG  - 309-16
AB  - The prophylactic use of fluconazole is common in blood and marrow transplant
      (BMT) recipients. To evaluate how fluconazole has influenced the development of
      azole resistance and candidemia, weekly mouthwashings were done, and fluconazole 
      susceptibility was determined for 1475 colonizing and invasive isolates obtained 
      from patients undergoing BMT. Of 585 patients, 256 (44%) were colonized with
      Candida species during the course of BMT. Of these, 136 patients (53%) had at
      least 1 mouthwashing sample that yielded Candida species other than C. albicans
      on culture. Only 4.6% of patients developed candidemia. Overall, C. albicans was 
      the most common colonizing isolate, but it caused only 7% of cases of candidemia.
      About 5% of colonizing C. albicans strains and 100% (2 of 2) invasive C. albicans
      strains were fluconazole-resistant. Colonization, cytomegalovirus disease, and
      bacteremia are risk factors for the development of candidemia. The use of
      prophylactic fluconazole is associated with a low incidence of candidemia and
      attributable mortality, despite colonization with azole-resistant Candida species
      in BMT recipients.

      3-year period. SETTING: The study is set in metropolitan, government secondary
      schools (13-17-year-olds) in Perth, Western Australia. The 14 schools involved in
      the SHAHRP study represent approximately 23% of government secondary schools in
      the Perth metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: The sample was selected using cluster 
      sampling, with stratification by socio-economic area, and involves over 2300
      intervention and control students from junior secondary schools. Seventy-three
      per cent (73.7%) of students completed surveys at both baseline and first
      follow-up. INTERVENTION: The intervention incorporated evidence-based approaches 
      to enhance potential for behaviour change in the target population. The
      intervention is a curriculum-based programmeme with an explicit harm minimization
      goal and will be conducted in two phases over a 2-year period. MEASURES AND
      FINDINGS: The early results of the study demonstrate initial knowledge and
      attitude change, predicted by the students' involvement in the intervention. A
      surprising impact of the first phase of SHAHRP was the significant difference in 
      alcohol consumption and harms between control and intervention groups, with the
      SHAHRP group demonstrating a significantly lower increase in alcohol consumption 
      than the control group. Students who were supervised drinkers at baseline and who
      received the SHAHRP intervention were overwhelmingly represented in the change
      results. CONCLUSIONS: Results from phase one of the SHAHRP study suggest that
      classroom-based alcohol education programmemes can reduce harm, particularly in
      students who are supervised drinkers prior to the intervention.

TI  - Endovascular treatment of experimental canine aneurysms: feasibility with MR
      imaging guidance.
PG  - 516-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to 
      guide and monitor endovascular therapeutic procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Endovascular therapeutic procedures were performed with MR imaging guidance in
      eight dogs by using a 1.5-T MR unit with echo-planar imaging capabilities.
      Carotid arterial aneurysms were surgically created in four dogs. The ability to
      depict, track, and position catheters, guide wires, and Guglielmi detachable
      coils was assessed. Catheters were first positioned with fluoroscopic guidance.
      Tracking and depiction were achieved with MR imaging by using commercially
      available catheters filled with a gadopentetate dimeglumine solution and a fast, 
      two-dimensional, time-resolved, variable-rate k-space sampling technique.
      RESULTS: When either a catheter or the coaxial space between a catheter and a
      guide wire was filled with a solution of gadopentetate dimeglumine, catheter
      movement was always depicted. In the animals with aneurysms, it was possible to
      depict movement of a catheter into and out of the aneurysm. This was achieved by 
      superimposing reconstructed images obtained during catheter movement onto a
      previously acquired MR angiogram ("road map"). Prototype Guglielmi detachable
      coils were successfully positioned and detached. Aneurysm obliteration was
      monitored with the acquisition of new road map images. CONCLUSION: The results
      demonstrate the feasibility of using MR imaging to guide endovascular therapeutic
      procedures.

TI  - Effect of passive smoking in pregnancy on neonatal nucleated red blood cells.
PG  - E34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether the absolute nucleated red blood cell (RBC) count
      is elevated in term, appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants born to women 
      exposed to passive smoking in pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared
      absolute nucleated RBC counts taken during the first 12 hours of life in 2 groups
      of term, vaginally delivered infants, 1 group born to mothers who were routinely 
      exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy (n = 55) either at home or at the
      workplace, and the other to mothers who were not routinely exposed to any tobacco
      smoke (n = 31). We excluded infants of women with conditions known to elevate
      nucleated RBC counts. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in birth 
      weight, maternal age, gravidity, parity, maternal analgesia during labor, 1- and 
      5-minute Apgar scores. Gestational age was minimally higher in the control group 
      (39.6 +/- 1.1 vs 39.2 +/-.8 weeks). The median absolute nucleated RBC count in
      the passive smoking group was 357 x 10(6)/L (range: 0-5091 x 10(6)/L) versus 237 
      x 10(6)/L (range: 0-1733 x 10(6)/L) in nonsmoking controls. Stepwise regression
      analysis that included Apgar scores, gestational age, and the passive smoking
      status (yes/no) as independent variables showed significant correlation of
      absolute nucleated RBC count only with the passive smoking status. CONCLUSION: At
      birth, term AGA infants born to mothers exposed to passive smoking have increased
      circulating absolute nucleated RBC counts compared with those of controls. We
      speculate that passive smoking in pregnancy should be avoided, because it may
      have subtle negative effects on fetal oxygenation.

TI  - Fetal haemodynamic changes in fetuses during fetal development evaluated by
      arterial pressure pulse and blood flow velocity waveforms.
PG  - 669-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between diameter pulse (pressure pulse) and flow
      velocity waveforms in the fetal descending aorta in fetuses with intrauterine
      growth retardation and acceleration. DESIGN: Blood flow through a tubular system 
      can be expressed by the ratio of blood pressure to vascular resistance. Doppler
      ultrasound and a phase locked loop echo tracking system coupled to a B-mode
      ultrasonic imager (central frequency 3.5 MHz) were used to assess downstream
      resistance and change in blood pressure, respectively. SETTING: Tertiary referral
      unit in a teaching hospital PARTICIPANTS: Serial study between 21 and 40 weeks of
      22 women with normally grown fetuses at intervals of four weeks; 25 women with
      small for gestational age fetuses with uteroplacental insufficiency (high
      umbilical artery pulsatility index); and six women with large for gestational age
      fetuses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured the maximum systolic and minimum
      diastolic diameter of the fetal descending aorta (the pulse amplitude) and then
      calculated the pulsatile waveform time integral above the least diastolic
      diameter (pulsatile area) and total waveform time integral (perfusion area).
      RESULTS: Normal fetal growth was associated with an increase in systolic and
      diastolic diameters in the fetal descending aorta with advancing gestational age.
      Pulse amplitude, pulsatile and perfusion areas increased with gestational age.
      The increased pulse amplitude and increased pulsatile area in association with a 
      decrease of the pulsatility index in the descending aorta during the second
      trimester suggested that pulse pressure and stroke volume were increased. In the 
      group with intrauterine growth retardation, systolic and diastolic diameters of
      the descending aorta and perfusion area were within the normal range. Moreover,
      there was an increase in the diastolic diameter per unit fetal weight and a
      decrease in the pulsatile area. In the large for gestational age fetuses, there
      was an increase in the pulse amplitude and pulsatile area. CONCLUSION: These
      findings suggest that in growth restricted fetuses there is an increase in
      diastolic pressure and a reduction in stroke volume, while in large for
      gestational age fetuses there is an increase in the pulse pressure and stroke
      volume. It is possible that measurement of pressure pulse waveform in relation to
      Doppler velocity waveform may be used to infer changes of blood flow.

TI  - Surgical management of spinal involvement in children and adolescents with
      Gaucher's disease.
PG  - 383-8
AB  - Gaucher's disease is an uncommon hereditary glycolipid storage disorder
      characterized by the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the lysosomes of
      macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Skeletal manifestations are
      variable in severity and typically involve the long bones. Vertebral involvement 
      is less well characterized, particularly in children and adolescents. We report
      on the surgical management of spinal involvement in four children and adolescents
      with Gaucher's disease; two for kyphotic deformity and two for kyphotic deformity
      associated with neurologic compromise. We recommend anterior spinal release with 
      fusion and posterior spinal fusion with segmental instrumentation in cases of
      kyphotic deformity. In cases of spinal cord compromise at the apex of the
      kyphotic deformity with retropulsion of involved bone, anterior decompression
      also should be performed. Routine surveillance for spinal deformity in patients
      with Gaucher's disease is necessary to allow early intervention before the
      development of severe deformity and neurologic compromise.

TI  - New antiepileptic drugs: into the new millennium.
PG  - 1135-41
AB  - There has been an explosion of new antiepileptic drug availability for physicians
      to treat patients with recurrent seizures. Principal antiepileptic drugs
      consisted of 6 key agents for both generalized and partial epilepsy for nearly 8 
      decades. Since 1993, the availability of newer "second-generation" agents has
      nearly doubled the armamentarium available for the 2.5 million patients who have 
      recurrent seizures. This new influx of medications has flooded the medical and
      lay community with choices never before appreciated. The promise of improved
      tolerability with different safety and efficacy profiles has been exciting for
      all involved in epilepsy management. While most of the newer agents have been
      approved for adjunctive use in medically refractory partial epilepsy with
      recurrent complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures, efficacy is
      expanding to include generalized epilepsy and children for some agents. Arch Fam

TI  - Parameters for contralateral approach to ophthalmic segment aneurysms of the
      internal carotid artery.
PG  - 1130-6; discussion 1136-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to define more accurately the feasibility
      and indications of the contralateral pterional approach to ophthalmic segment
      aneurysms of the internal carotid artery (ICA). METHODS: Between 1995 and 1999,
      46 patients with ophthalmic segment aneurysms of the ICA were surgically treated 
      in our institution. Eleven of the 46 aneurysms were operated using the
      contralateral pterional approach. All aneurysms were successfully clipped without
      complications; three patients required bone resection around the aneurysm neck.
      We studied the 11 patients who were treated with the contralateral approach by
      defining six parameters to assess the feasibility of the approach and to predict 
      the necessity for bone resection: 1) Parameter A, the distance between the
      anterior aspect of the optic chiasm and the limbus sphenoidale; 2) Parameter B,
      the distance between the bilateral optic nerves at the entrance to the optic
      canal; 3) Parameter C, the interrelation of the optic nerve and the ICA,
      expressed as a/b in which a is the length from the midline to the optic nerve and
      b is the length from the midline to the ICA; 4) Parameter D, the size of the
      aneurysm neck; 5) Parameter E, the direction of the aneurysm from the ICA wall on
      the anteroposterior angiogram; and 6) Parameter F, the distance from the medial
      side of the estimated distal dural ring to the proximal aneurysm neck on the
      lateral angiogram. RESULTS: Parameters A to F were 8.8 mm (range, 5.4-11.1 mm),
      14.5 mm (range, 10.4-22.2 mm), 0.9 mm (range, 0.6-1.3 mm), and 3.0 mm (range,
      2.3-4.7 mm), 5 to 160 degrees, and 1.3 mm (range, 0.3-2.4 mm), respectively. All 
      patients had excellent operative outcomes without visual dysfunction. Three
      patients required drilling of the bone around the optic canal on the craniotomy
      side; bone drilling was not required when Parameter E was between 30 and 160
      degrees and Parameter F was more than 1 mm. CONCLUSION: Parameters A to D are
      important for assessing the feasibility of the contralateral approach to
      ICA-ophthalmic segment aneurysms, and Parameters E and F are most useful for
      calculating the difficulty of this approach.

TI  - Changes in the management of severe traumatic brain injury: 1991-1997.
PG  - 16-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To survey the management of head-injured patients in 1997 and to
      identify differences compared with a survey conducted in 1991. DESIGN: A two-page
      questionnaire was mailed to all neurosurgeons in North America certified by the
      American Board of Neurologic Surgeons, asking their views regarding the most
      appropriate acute care of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
      SETTING: North American neurosurgical practices. PATIENTS: Not applicable.
      INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with a 1991 survey, 
      there was a significant increase in the proportion of neurosurgeons who felt
      these patients should have intracranial pressure monitoring (28% vs. 83%) and a
      decrease in the proportion who used prophylactic hyperventilation therapy (83%
      vs. 36%) and steroids (64% vs. 19%). Ninety-seven percent of respondents felt
      that the cerebral perfusion pressure should be maintained at >70 mm Hg, and 44%
      indicated that patients with severe TBI should be treated at Level I trauma
      centers. CONCLUSIONS: There have been significant changes in the acute management
      of patients with severe TBI since 1991. Current practices more closely reflect
      the recommendations of evidence-based guidelines.

TI  - Change counselling in diabetes: the development of a training programme for the
      diabetes team.
PG  - 263-78
AB  - Skills in counselling for behaviour change may help staff working in diabetes
      care to facilitate self management in people with diabetes. A feasibility study
      was conducted to define the essential competencies (attitudes, knowledge and
      skills), training methods, and assess whether this approach was practicable in a 
      diabetes resource centre. Semi structured interviews with staff were routinely
      conducted throughout the duration of the study. The findings suggest that the
      stages of change model, motivational interviewing and behavioural techniques are 
      relevant to work in this area. Acquiring the competencies was harder to achieve
      than anticipated, though most were evident after one years training. The most
      valued training methods were individual supervision and video examples. However, 
      the competencies were difficult to apply in the clinical setting given time
      constraints, the strength of existing staff routines and the patients' readiness 
      to change. The lessons learned and suggestions for future work are presented.

TI  - Management of low lumbar fractures by dorsal decompression, fusion, and
      lumbosacral laminar distraction fixation.
PG  - 142-8
AB  - OBJECT: The authors conducted a study to assess the anatomical appropriateness of
      using the S-2 dorsal neuroforamina as a hook fixation point, and they present the
      results of their clinical experience of using a nonscrew alternative for the
      surgical management of low lumbar (L-4 or L-5) burst fractures. METHODS: The
      technique used involves lumbar laminar fixation, rod contouring (to preserve
      lordosis), S- sublaminar wire fixation, S-2 dorsal neuroforaminal hook fixation, 
      cross-fixation, and distraction. Because the S-2 dorsal neuroforamina was used as
      a unique fixation point, anatomical data obtained in 10 cadavers supporting the
      technique's utility are provided. Surgery was performed in six patients by using 
      this technique, and solid fusion was achieved in all. CONCLUSIONS: The
      reestablished lordotic posture was preserved in all but one patient. From an
      anatomical perspective, the findings corroborate the use of the S-2 dorsal
      foramina as a hook fixation point. This technique provides a viable adjunct or
      alternative to sacral screw and ilial fixation techniques.

TI  - Variation in time spent on the waiting list for elective vascular surgery: a case
      study.
PG  - 227-38
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the variation in time spent on the waiting list for elective
      vascular surgery provided by a single team of specialists. DESIGN: A prospective 
      cohort study. SETTING: An acute care hospital in Ontario. POPULATION: One
      thousand and eighty-four consecutive patients with vascular problems accepted for
      elective surgery between 1994 and 1998. INTERVENTIONS: Abdominal aortic aneurysm 
      (AAA) repair; carotid endarterectomy (CAD); surgery for peripheral vascular
      disease (PVD); and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for long-term access in patients
      with renal failure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Time-to-treatment curves, admission rates. 
      RESULTS: The weekly admission rate was 9.8% on average. The proportion of
      patients who underwent operation was 50% at 7 weeks, 75% at 14 weeks and 90% at
      26 weeks. The weekly admission rate varied according to clinical priority, from
      42% in priority class 1 to 6% in class 5. In any priority class, the admission
      rate was not constant over time. Although the proportion of patients operated on 
      within the maximum recommended time in classes 1, 2, 3 and 4 was 52%, 50%, 35%
      and 20% respectively, the last 10% of patients waited 5 to 16 weeks, 10 to 16
      weeks, 16 to 37 weeks, and 25 to 39 weeks respectively. There were statistically 
      significant differences in waiting time by surgical procedure among the least
      urgent cases, with median times of 7, 10 and 19 weeks for AVF, PVD and CAD
      procedures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When queuing procedures are uniform, the
      waiting times for access to elective vascular surgery provided by the same team
      of specialists differ considerably for patients with equal surgical needs and
      urgency. It remains to be examined whether delays in scheduling operations and
      cancellations affect the waiting time after adjustment for urgency and
      comorbidity.

TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil activation by ranitidine contributes to prevent
      stress-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats.
PG  - 2858-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Activated neutrophils play a critical role in stress-induced gastric
      mucosal injury. We investigated the effect of ranitidine, an H2-receptor
      antagonist, on neutrophil activation in vitro and in rats with stress-induced
      gastric mucosal injury. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled
      study. SETTING: Research laboratory at a university medical center.
      INTERVENTIONS: Effects of ranitidine on neutrophil elastase release, production
      of O2-, intracellular calcium concentration and expression of adhesion molecules 
      CD11b and CD18 were examined in human neutrophils in vitro. The effect of
      ranitidine (30 mg/kg iv) on the development of gastric mucosal injury, neutrophil
      accumulation, and lipid peroxidation was investigated in male Wistar rats
      subjected to water-immersion restraint stress. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
      Ranitidine inhibited the release of neutrophil elastase as well as the production
      of O2-, the increase in the concentrations of intracellular calcium, a second
      messenger of neutrophil activation, and increases in CD11b and CD18 expression,
      in activated neutrophils. Ranitidine did not affect the expression of E-selectin 
      on endothelial cells in vitro. Ranitidine significantly inhibited gastric
      accumulation of neutrophils and gastric mucosal lipid peroxidation in rats
      subjected to stress. Although oral administration of acid reversed the preventive
      effect of pirenzepine, an anti-cholinergic drug that inhibits gastric acid
      secretion, it did not affect the preventive effect of ranitidine. Leukocytopenia 
      produced effects similar to those of ranitidine in animals subjected to stress.
      CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of neutrophil activation and gastric acid secretion by
      ranitidine might contribute to reduce stress-induced gastric mucosal injury.

TI  - Phase I trials in pediatric oncology: perceptions of pediatricians from the
      United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group.
PG  - 1900-5
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify areas of concern regarding the conduct of phase I trials,
      the perceived expectations and motivations of the parents of children entered,
      the expectations of toxicity and benefit, and the ethical concerns of pediatric
      hematologists and oncologists in the United Kingdom and North America. METHODS: A
      survey instrument consisting of 19 open- and closed-ended questions was sent to
      United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG)- and Pediatric Oncology
      Group (POG)-affiliated pediatricians. RESULTS: Fifty-three UKCCSG- and 78
      POG-affiliated pediatricians responded. Thirty-two UKCCSG and 51 POG respondents 
      had previously entered at least one child into a phase I study. Overall,
      respondents believed that parents entered their children for medical benefit,
      altruism, and hope of cure. Although many respondents believed that children
      could benefit from medical improvement, feelings of altruism, and maintenance of 
      hope, the chance of cure or complete remission was thought to be small.
      Similarly, parents were thought to potentially benefit through altruism and
      maintenance of hope. Whereas 83% of UKCCSG respondents indicated that phase I
      trials were associated with ethical difficulties, this was a concern for 48% of
      POG respondents. The main ethical concerns of respondents were risk of toxicity, 
      consent of the child, unrealistic hope, and coercion. CONCLUSION: The respondents
      in this survey expressed mainly ethical concerns regarding the conduct of phase I
      trials and had realistic expectations of the potential for toxicity and benefit
      for those children who participate in these studies.

TI  - Acute appendicitis in children: comparison of clinical diagnosis with ultrasound 
      and CT imaging.
PG  - 94-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence that imaging with ultrasound and CT can be
      of substantial diagnostic value in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in
      children, but there is limited information of the impact of imaging on the
      management of these patients and its possible effect on surgical findings.
      OBJECTIVE: We studied the impact of imaging in the management of acute
      appendicitis, in particular its effect on the rate of negative appendectomies and
      perforations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the clinical
      records and imaging findings of 633 consecutive children and adolescents seen on 
      an emergency basis with clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis. Two hundred
      seventy patients were operated upon on clinical evidence alone, while 360 were
      referred for US or CT, and occasionally both, because of doubtful clinical
      findings. RESULTS: Acute appendicitis was found in 237 of those on clinical
      grounds alone, 68 of whom had perforation and related complications. Thus the
      rate of negative exploration and the rate of perforation were13 % and 29 %,
      respectively. One hundred eighty-two patients had preoperative US (sensitivity 74
      %, specificity 94 %), 119 had CT (sensitivity 84 %, specificity 99 %), and 59 had
      both US and CT (sensitivity 75 %, specificity 100 %, but often with
      interpretation at variance with each other). The rate of negative appendectomy
      and perforation was 8 % and 23 %, respectively, for US, 5 % and 54 % for CT, and 
      9 % and 71 % when both examinations were performed. There is no statistical
      significance between the rates of diagnostic performance of US, CT, or their
      combination, nor between the negative appendectomy rates of each group, but the
      rate of perforation was significantly higher when CT was performed, alone or
      after US. CONCLUSION: The retrospective nature of the study prevents precise
      definition of the clinical characteristics and selection criteria for diagnostic 
      examinations that may contribute to the management of children with suspected
      acute appendicitis. It was designed, however, to reflect the diagnostic approach 
      and management of these patients, under the care of many decision makers and
      interpreters of imaging examinations, prevalent today in most hospital-based
      clinical practices. It is suggested that imaging increases diagnostic accuracy in
      difficult cases, but it might be one of the factors increasing the rate of
      perforations.

TI  - Relaxation therapy for insomnia: nighttime and day time effects.
PG  - 665-78
AB  - We compared day time functioning in college students with and without insomnia
      and explored changes in day time functioning after progressive relaxation (PR)
      treatment for insomnia. Students with insomnia (SWI; n = 57) were compared to a
      control group of students not complaining of insomnia (SNI; n = 61) on
      self-reported sleep variables and five questionnaires: Insomnia Impact Scale
      (IIS), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale (DBAS), Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Penn State Worry
      Questionnaire (PSWQ). SWI demonstrated significant impairment on all day time
      functioning and sleep measures compared to SNI. To investigate treatment effects 
      on day time functioning, 28 SWI were randomly assigned to PR. Treated SWI were
      compared to untreated SWI and SNI at posttreatment. Treated participants improved
      sleep in comparison to untreated SWI, but failed to show significant improvements
      in day time functioning. Insomnia treatments focused on improving sleep may not
      improve day time functioning, or day time gains may emerge more slowly than sleep
      gains. This study documents the wide range of day time functioning complaints in 
      young adults with insomnia and suggests that the goal of insomnia treatment
      should be to not only improve sleep but also to improve the subjective experience
      of day time functioning.

TI  - Interleukin 15 mediates epithelial changes in celiac disease.
PG  - 996-1006
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Villous atrophy and crypt proliferation are key epithelial
      features of untreated celiac disease. We tried to define whether cytokines such
      as interleukin (IL)-15, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7, which share chains of their
      receptors, could influence the epithelial modifications. METHODS: Duodenal biopsy
      specimens (14 treated and 13 untreated celiac patients, 7 controls) were cultured
      in vitro for 24 hours with or without gliadin (1 mg/mL), IL-15, IL-7, IL-4, or
      IL-2 (10 ng/mL). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma
      were also used in some specimens of untreated celiacs. Epithelial expression of
      Ki67, FAS, and transferrin receptor (TFR) was detected by immunohistochemistry,
      and apoptosis by TUNEL technique (percentage of positive enterocytes).
      IL-15-positive cells were detected by immunohistochemistry in celiac disease and 
      control biopsy specimens; presence of IL-15 was also determined by
      semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Only IL-15 induced
      enterocyte expression of Ki67, TFR, and FAS in treated celiac (P<0.01 vs. medium)
      and enterocyte apoptosis in untreated celiac disease specimens. Anti-IL-15
      monoclonal antibodies neutralized gliadin-induced enterocyte TFR and FAS
      expression in treated celiac and enterocyte apoptosis in untreated celiac disease
      specimens (P<0.05 vs. gliadin). IL-15-positive cells were increased in untreated 
      celiacs (P<0.001 vs. treated celiacs and controls). CONCLUSIONS: IL-15 is
      involved in the modulation of epithelial changes in celiac disease, indicating
      that this cytokine has an unforeseen role in the pathologic manifestations of
      celiac disease.

TI  - The cultural relevance of community support programs.
PG  - 879-84
AB  - The research and practice literature was examined to determine whether community 
      support programs are responsive to ethnocultural issues and to derive strategies 
      for developing culturally relevant programming. Great variation exists across
      cultures in family practices, conceptions of mental illness, stigma attributed to
      mental illness, and expectations of the provider system. Ethnic minority cultures
      are typically centered on the family, whereas Western European cultures are
      characterized as more individualistic and as valuing independence. Research shows
      that some rehabilitation approaches based on Western models may produce adverse
      effects when used with patients from ethnic minority groups. Interventions that
      incorporate family networks and use group modalities are considered culturally
      congruent. Clients from sociocentric cultures may have strong support networks
      and display prosocial behaviors that can be tapped in the rehabilitation process.
      Community support programs should incorporate cultural factors into psychosocial 
      assessments, train staff to conduct ethnographic interviews, and use focus groups
      to gain an understanding of the cultures of clients they serve.

TI  - Risk stratification in patients with inferior acute myocardial infarction treated
      by percutaneous coronary interventions: the role of admission troponin T.
PG  - 2038-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) elevations on admission indicate a
      high-risk subgroup of patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI). This finding has been attributed to less effective reperfusion 
      after thrombolytic therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the role of
      admission cTnT on the efficacy of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in
      inferior AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred fifty-nine consecutive patients
      with inferior ST-segment AMI were enrolled and followed up for a mean of 448
      days. Patients were stratified by cTnT on admission. A cTnT >/=0.1 microg/L was
      found in 58% of patients. These patients had longer time intervals from onset of 
      symptoms to therapy (P:<0. 001) and higher 30-day (10.8% versus 1.5%, P:=0.027)
      and long-term (17.2% versus 4.5%, P:=0.023) cardiac mortalities. Rates of the
      combined end point of death, nonfatal reinfarction, and need for repeated target 
      vessel revascularization procedures were not different in cTnT groups (log rank, 
      0.69; P:=0.41). PCI was attempted in 93.3% of cTnT-positive and 98.5%
      cTnT-negative patients (P:=0.24) but was less frequently successful in patients
      with cTnT >/=0.1 microg/L (77.9% versus 96.9%, P:<0.001). Coronary stenting
      reduced 30-day and long-term cardiac mortality, particularly among cTnT-positive 
      patients. In a multivariate analysis, cTnT indicated an approximately
      5-fold-higher risk (adjusted OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 0.79 to 27.11; P:=0.089) and was a 
      strong albeit not independent risk predictor. CONCLUSIONS: In inferior AMI, a
      positive admission cTnT is associated with lower success rates of direct PCI and 
      higher rates of cardiac events over the short and long term. These patients
      benefit from coronary stenting.

TI  - Methotrexate and corticosteroid therapy for pediatric localized scleroderma.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Localized scleroderma (LS) can cause permanent disability, and
      there is no universally accepted effective treatment. Methotrexate (MTX) has been
      shown to be effective in the treatment of systemic sclerosis. OBJECTIVES: To
      determine the efficacy and tolerability of MTX and corticosteroid therapy in
      patients with LS. METHODS: MTX, 0.3 to 0.6 mg/kg per week, was given to 10
      patients (6 girls, 4 boys; mean age, 6.8 years; mean disease duration before
      starting treatment, 4 years) with active LS. In addition, pulse intravenous
      methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg for 3 days monthly for 3 months, was given to 9
      patients at the initiation of therapy. RESULTS: One patient discontinued taking
      MTX after a month; the remaining 9 patients responded. The median time to
      response was 3 months (95% CI, 1.15-4.85). One responder discontinued taking MTX 
      after a year because of leukopenia; the LS worsened within 2 months. In another
      patient LS flared up after 10 months and responded to an increased dose of MTX
      and intravenous methylprednisolone. At the last follow-up visit, all patients who
      continued to receive MTX therapy had inactive skin lesions. CONCLUSION: Treatment
      with MTX and corticosteroids appears to be effective in the treatment of LS and
      is generally well tolerated. A placebo-controlled study is necessary to confirm
      the efficacy of MTX therapy in LS.

      weakness.
PG  - 938-43
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the test-retest reliability of selected simulated work
      performance tasks in persons with neuropathic and myopathic weakness and control 
      subjects, and the association between muscular performance during these work
      tasks and conventional isolated muscle group testing. DESIGN: Measurement of
      three tasks performed on a work simulation device on two different days separated
      by 1 week. Associations between work task performance and previously reported
      strength measures in six muscle groups by hand-held dynamometry (HHD) were
      examined. SETTING: Human performance laboratory of a university. PARTICIPANTS:
      Convenience sample of ambulatory outpatients with hereditary motor and sensory
      neuropathy, type I (n = 9), myotonic muscular dystrophy (n = 10), and able-bodied
      controls (n = 11). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For work simulation, isokinetic peak
      torque and total work; and for HHD, maximal isometric torque. RESULTS: Mean
      between-session differences for work simulation tasks ranged from -11% to +4% for
      peak torque and from -12% to +12% for total work; test sessions did not differ
      significantly for either patient or control groups. All groups had
      between-session intraclass correlation coefficients usually >.80, indicating good
      consistency. In general, correlations between peak torque during work simulation 
      and HHD were strongest in the control group. CONCLUSION: Persons with
      neuromuscular weakness reliably performed the simulated work tasks examined in
      this investigation. Work simulation tasks may be a useful tool to assess muscular
      performance in persons with neuromuscular weakness.

TI  - Catheter-associated urinary tract infection is rarely symptomatic: a prospective 
      study of 1,497 catheterized patients.
PG  - 678-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most
      common nosocomial infection, accounting for more than 1 million cases each year
      in US hospitals and nursing homes. OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical features of 
      CAUTI. SETTING AND PATIENTS: A university hospital; 1,497 newly catheterized
      patients. DESIGN: Every day that the catheter was in place, a quantitative urine 
      culture and urine leukocyte count were obtained, and the patient was queried by a
      research worker regarding symptoms. To more precisely define the role of CAUTI in
      patients' symptoms, a subset of 1,034 patients, 89 of whom developed CAUTI with
      more than 10(3) colony-forming units per milliliter, who did not have another
      potentially confounding site of infection besides the urinary tract, was
      analyzed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of fever, symptoms commonly associated with 
      community-acquired urinary tract infection, and peripheral leukocytosis. RESULTS:
      There were 235 new cases of nosocomial CAUTI during the study period. More than
      90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic; only 123 infections (52%) were
      detected by patients' physicians using the hospital laboratory. In the subset
      analysis, there were no significant differences between patients with and without
      CAUTI in signs or symptoms commonly associated with urinary tract
      infection-fever, dysuria, urgency, or flank pain-or in leukocytosis. Only 1 of
      the 235 episodes of CAUTI that were prospectively studied was unequivocally
      associated with secondary bloodstream infection. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas CAUTIs are 
      a major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant organisms in the hospital, they are
      rarely symptomatic and infrequently cause bloodstream infection. Symptoms
      referable to the urinary tract, fever, or peripheral leukocytosis have little
      predictive value for the diagnosis of CAUTI.

TI  - Aerosolized diuretics for preterm infants with (or developing) chronic lung
      disease.
PG  - CD001694
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung disease in preterm infants is often complicated with lung edema.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to assess the risks and benefits of
      aerosolized diuretic administration in preterm infants with or developing chronic
      lung disease (CLD). Primary objectives are to assess effects on short term
      outcome (changes in need for oxygen or ventilatory support) and effects on
      long-term outcome. Secondary objectives are to assess changes in pulmonary
      mechanics and potential complications of therapy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We used the
      standard search method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the
      following keywords: inverted question mark<bronchopulmonary dysplasia> or
      <chronic lung disease> inverted question mark and <explode diuretics>, limited to
      <human> and limited to <infant, newborn> or <infant>. We searched Medline
      (1966-1998), Embase (1974-1998) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register
      (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library (1998, Issue 4). In addition, we hand searched
      several abstract books of national and international American and European
      Societies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included in this analysis trials in which
      preterm infants with or developing chronic lung disease and at least five days of
      age were all randomly allocated to receive an aerosolized loop diuretic. Eligible
      studies needed to assess at least one of the outcome variables defined a priori
      for this systematic review. Primary outcome variables included important clinical
      outcomes, and secondary outcome variables included pulmonary mechanics and
      potential complications of therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the
      standard method for the Cochrane Collaboration which is described in the Cochrane
      Collaboration Handbook. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded
      separately all data for each study, using a form that was designed specifically
      for this review. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. We combined
      parallel and cross-over trials and, whenever possible, transformed baseline and
      final outcome data measured on a continuous scale into change scores using
      Follmann's formula. MAIN RESULTS: We identified eight studies which met selection
      criteria. Most studies focused on pathophysiological parameters and did not
      assess effects on important clinical outcomes defined in this review or the
      potential complications of diuretic therapy. No study assessed the amount of
      diuretic effectively delivered to the patient. Furosemide was the only diuretic
      used in the eight studies included in this review. Among preterm infants < 3
      weeks of age developing CLD, not enough information is available to assess the
      effect of aerosolized furosemide on outcome or lung function. Among infants > 3
      weeks with CLD, a single aerosolized dose of 1 mg/kg of furosemide may
      transiently improve pulmonary mechanics. Not enough information is available to
      assess the effect of chronic administration of aerosolized furosemide on
      oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: In preterm infants >
      3 weeks with CLD administration of a single dose of aerosolized furosemide
      improves pulmonary mechanics. In view of the lack of data from randomized trials 
      concerning effects on important clinical outcomes, routine or sustained use of
      aerosolized loop diuretics in infants with (or developing) CLD cannot be
      recommended based on current evidence. More double-blinded randomized trials are 
      needed (1) to analyze factors likely to affect the response to aerosolized
      furosemide, e.g. , washout period and delivery of furosemide to distal airways,
      and (2) to assess the effects of chronic administration of aerosolized furosemide
      on mortality, O2 dependency, ventilator dependency, length of hospital stay and
      long-term outcome.

TI  - Cryopreservation of rat aortic valves results in increased structural failure.
PG  - III75-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cause of valve allograft failure is most likely multifactorial
      and may include mechanical, immunological, and other factors. Cryopreservation of
      these valves is often used to extend storage times. However, there has been
      considerable confusion as to the effects of cryopreservation on valve durability.
      Our objective was to determine the effects of cryopreservation on
      histopathological changes in rat aortic valve grafts. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Syngeneic rat aortic valve grafts (Lewis to Lewis; n=24) and allogeneic rat
      aortic valve grafts (Brown Norway to Lewis; n=24) were implanted infrarenally,
      either fresh or after cryopreservation. At 7, 14, and 28 days, the valves were
      explanted, and histological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed
      in a blinded fashion. Fresh syngeneic graft leaflets retained their normal
      structure for the 28-day period of observation. Cryopreserved syngeneic grafts
      showed retrovalvar thrombus formation, with leaflet destruction at 7, 14, and 28 
      days. Fresh allogeneic graft leaflets showed significant leaflet thickening and
      progressive destruction at 14 and 28 days. Cryopreserved allogeneic grafts had
      evidence of retrovalvar thrombus formation with leaflet destruction at 7, 14, and
      28 days. Cryopreserved syngeneic grafts resulted in significant infiltration of
      mononuclear (ED1(+)) cells not seen with fresh syngeneic grafts but similar to
      fresh allogeneic grafts. All allogeneic grafts resulted in significant
      infiltration of T-lymphocytes (CD3(+), CD8(+), CD43(+)). CONCLUSIONS:
      Cryopreservation appears to predispose syngeneic and allogeneic rat aortic valve 
      leaflets to accelerated injury and destruction. This mode of failure resembles
      that of fresh allogeneic valve grafts.

TI  - Mild familial neurofibromatosis 2 associates with expression of merlin with
      altered COOH-terminus.
PG  - 1132-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand molecular details of the pathogenesis of a very mild and
      homogenous form of neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). BACKGROUND: Inactivation of the NF2
      tumor suppressor gene leads to the development of multiple nervous system tumors,
      accompanied by loss of the NF2 gene product, merlin, or schwannomin. The severity
      of disease varies between patients, and the biologic basis of this variation is
      poorly understood. METHODS: We studied the genotype-phenotype correlation in a
      large pedigree with extremely mild and uniform disease manifesting as slowly
      growing bilateral vestibular nerve schwannomas of late onset. RESULTS: The tumors
      demonstrated a low proliferation rate and loss of the wild-type NF2 allele. The
      disease is caused by a novel mutation in the NF2 gene at intron 15 splice donor
      site (1737 + 3 a --> t), which was identified in all carriers by the
      minisequencing method. The mutation resulted in splicing out of exon 15 and
      production of two transcripts: a novel mutant transcript with exon 16 and
      overexpression of isoform III, normally detected at a low level. Both transcripts
      encode for the COOH-terminus of isoform III. Immunoblotting of patient
      fibroblasts and tumor tissue demonstrated variant merlin with altered
      COOH-terminus. CONCLUSIONS: The mutational skip of exon 15 and the expression of 
      a protein with the COOH-terminus of isoform III correlates with the exceptionally
      mild NF2, and suggests tumor suppressor activity for isoform III. The detection
      of expressed mutant proteins may provide useful information for prediction of the
      clinical outcome of individual mutations.

TI  - Infection of left atrial thrombus associated with mitral stenosis: A case report.
PG  - 1201-3
AB  - We describe the first reported case of an infected left atrial thrombus. The case
      of the 65-year-old male patient in this report was associated with mitral
      stenosis and involved Escherichia coli, and was treated successfully with
      surgical resection of the infected thrombus. This case suggests that such
      infection should be considered as a possible complication of intracardiac
      thrombus when bacteremia is present.

TI  - Transmediastinal gunshot injuries.
PG  - 54-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transmediastinal gunshot injuries are a rarely reported injury. Until
      recently, assessment of the thoracic aorta by angiography preceded the
      investigation of the esophagus. This order has been recently debated. METHODS:
      There were 118 patients with potential transmediastinal injuries included in this
      retrospective study. Unstable patients who were unresponsive to resuscitation
      were taken to the operating room without previous investigation. Stable patients 
      were routinely investigated initially for injury of the aorta and then for injury
      of the esophagus. RESULTS: There were 51 patients who underwent urgent
      thoracotomy/sternotomy. In 27, the hemorrhage was of mediastinal origin; 17 of
      these patients died of intraoperative bleeding. Eight of the patients had aortic 
      injury, and only one of this group survived. There were 57 stable patients who
      were investigated initially for injury of the aorta by angiography. It was
      positive in only one patient who underwent an operation with good results. An
      investigation of the esophagus followed and revealed esophageal injury in 17
      patients. All of them were treated operatively, 15 of them with satisfactory
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Angiography should at present precede esophageal
      investigations. There is a need for shortening the time between admission and
      operation. Other modalities that could expedite the investigation of the thoracic
      aorta and the esophagus should be prospectively evaluated in multi-center
      studies.

      cells from the gut-associated lymphoid tissues and altered resistance to oral
      infections with Salmonella typhimurium.
PG  - 482-9
AB  - Studies were done to test whether ethanol (ETOH) consumption alters resistance to
      mucosal and systemic infections by Salmonella typhimurium. S. typhimurium-immune 
      and -nonimmune mice were fed 1 of 3 diets (an ETOH-containing liquid diet, an
      isocaloric liquid diet equal in volume to that of the ETOH-treated group, or
      laboratory chow) in a pair-feeding design and were infected orally or
      intravenously with S. typhimurium. The number of bacteria in spleen and liver and
      the effect of ETOH feeding and infection on the number of lymphoid cells in the
      gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) were determined. ETOH feeding resulted in 
      profound loss of GALT lymphoid cells and an increased number of Salmonella
      organisms in the intestines, liver, and spleen of infected nonimmune, but not of 
      immune, mice. These data show that ETOH consumption in this model impairs host
      defense mechanisms that control mucosal infections and inhibits the mechanisms
      that control levels of bacteria in the central organs.

TI  - Significance of resection margin in hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma: A
      critical reappraisal.
PG  - 544-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of the width and histologic involvement of
      the resection margin on postoperative recurrence after resection of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The significance of the 
      resection margin in hepatectomy for HCC remains controversial. A precise
      evaluation of the effects of the width and histologic involvement of the
      resection margin on postoperative recurrence is required to clarify the issue.
      METHODS: Two hundred eighty-eight patients with macroscopically complete
      resection of HCC were divided into groups with narrow (<1 cm) or wide (>/=1 cm)
      resection margins. The two groups were compared for postoperative recurrence rate
      and pattern of recurrence. A further analysis was performed to investigate the
      effects of histologic involvement of the resection margin on postoperative
      recurrence. RESULTS: Recurrence rates were similar between 150 patients with a
      narrow margin and 138 patients with a wide margin; the groups were comparable in 
      other clinicopathologic variables. Most recurrent tumors occurred in the liver
      remnant at a segment distant from the resection margin or at multiple segments.
      Thirty-four patients had margin involved histologically by microscopic invasion
      from the main tumor (n = 13), venous tumor thrombi (n = 13), or microsatellites
      separate from the main tumor (n = 8). These patients had significantly higher
      recurrence rates than those with a histologically clear margin. However, a
      positive histologic margin was not a significant risk factor for recurrence by
      multivariate analysis. Tumor stage and perioperative transfusion were the only
      independent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The width of the resection margin did not 
      influence the postoperative recurrence rates after hepatectomy for HCC. A
      positive histologic margin was associated with a higher incidence of
      postoperative recurrence, but in most patients this was related to the underlying
      venous invasion or microsatellites. Most intrahepatic recurrences were considered
      to arise from intrahepatic metastasis by means of venous dissemination, which a
      wide resection margin could not prevent.

TI  - Virtual image navigation: a new method to control intraoperative bleeding in
      neuroendoscopic surgery. Technical note.
PG  - 342-50
AB  - In this neuroendoscopic study the authors tested the newly developed "red-out
      module" of their visual navigation system that enables the neurosurgeon to
      achieve hemostasis if total visualization is lost due to hemorrhage ("red out")
      within the visual field. An optical position measurement system connected to the 
      endoscope guarantees that digitized endoscopic images are coupled with the
      accurate endoscopic position. Computerized images are simultaneously stored with 
      their respective position data, and this creates a virtual anatomical landscape. 
      The system was tested in in vivo bleeding conditions in a rat model. Artificial
      endoscopic cavities were created in the inguinal, pelvic, and jugular regions in 
      rats to imitate the conditions of the human ventricular system. Two experimental 
      settings were tested: Technique I, in which a computer landmark has been
      previously determined at the point where the vessel will be lesioned; and
      Technique II, in which a landmark has been previously set in the surrounding area
      of the vessel. Immediately after hemorrhage obscures the visual field (red out), 
      the computer automatically displays the virtual images on a separate monitor. The
      previously set landmarks and the graphic overlay of the coagulation fiber enable 
      the surgeon to navigate within the operative field based on the virtual images
      and to perform coagulation at the site of the lesion. A total of 175 vessels were
      coagulated: 43 arteries and 132 veins. In using Technique I, 130 (90.9%) of 143
      vessels and in using Technique II, 26 (81.2%) of 32 arteries were successfully
      coagulated. The authors' data revealed that virtual image guidance has the
      potential to be a helpful tool in neuroendoscopy.

TI  - Delayed neutrophil elastase inhibition prevents subsequent progression of acute
      lung injury induced by endotoxin inhalation in hamsters.
PG  - 2013-8
AB  - To define the role of neutrophil elastase (NE) in the progression of acute lung
      injury (ALI), we examined the effects of post-treatment with a specific NE
      inhibitor, sivelestat sodium hydrate (sivelestat), on ALI induced by endotoxin
      (ET) inhalation in hamsters. Inhalation of ET (300 microg/ml, 30 min) in
      conscious hamsters increased inflammatory cell count, protein concentration, and 
      hemorrhage in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) that peaked 24 h after ET
      inhalation. These changes were significant 2 h after ET inhalation and paralleled
      the increase in NE activity in BALF. When intravenously infused from 2 to 24 h
      post-ET inhalation, sivelestat (0.03 to 3 mg/kg/h) dose-dependently attenuated
      changes in these BALF parameters at 24 h post-ET inhalation in a manner dependent
      on the inhibition of NE activity in BALF. Histopathological analysis also
      indicated that sivelestat prevented the progression of lung inflammation such as 
      alveolar neutrophil infiltration and hemorrhage. In contrast, dexamethasone (3
      mg/kg, intravenously) was not effective in this model when administered 2 h after
      ET inhalation, although it was highly effective when applied before ET. We
      conclude that delayed inhibition of NE activity with sivelestat prevents
      subsequent progression of ALI in hamsters after ET inhalation. Thus NE may play
      an important role in the progression of ALI.

TI  - Lung function response to cold air challenge in asthmatic and healthy children of
      2-5 years of age.
PG  - 1805-9
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess feasibility, sensitivity, specificity,
      predictive value, and repeatability of cold, dry air challenge (CACh) as a
      diagnostic test for asthma in young children 2 to 5 yr of age. Response to a
      4-min single-step isocapnic CACh was measured in 38 asthmatics and 29 control
      subjects. Specific airway resistance (sRaw) by whole body plethysmography was the
      primary outcome. In addition, lung function was measured as respiratory
      resistance by the interrupter technique (Rint) and respiratory resistance and
      reactance at 5 Hz (Rrs5, Xrs5) by the impulse oscillation technique. At baseline,
      lung function measures differed significantly between asthmatics and healthy
      control subjects. CACh was readily performed in young children. Response was
      expressed as change from baseline in numbers of within-subject standard deviation
      (SDw). Hyperresponsiveness defined as change in lung function of more than 3 SDw 
      was detected by sRaw in 26 of 38 asthmatics versus 2 of 29 control subjects, by
      Rint in 12 of 38 asthmatics versus 1 of 29 control subjects, by Xrs5 in 9 of 38
      asthmatics versus zero of 29 control subjects and by Rrs5 in 7 of 38 asthmatics
      versus 1 of 29 control subjects. Thus sRaw had the highest sensitivity (68%).
      Specificity ranged from 93 to 100%. The correlation coefficient between sRaw
      responses to CACh repeated within 8 wk was 96%. In conclusion, CACh is feasible
      in young children age 2 to 5 yr. Whole body plethysmography (sRaw) was superior
      in separating asthmatics from healthy control subjects. Change in sRaw in
      response to CACh may be used as a diagnostic test for asthma in young children.

TI  - Variable expression of familial Alzheimer disease associated with presenilin 2
      mutation M239I.
PG  - 2006-8
AB  - In a family with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease, the authors found a
      mutation in the presenilin 2 (PS2) gene (PSEN2) that predicts a
      methionine-to-isoleucine change at PS2 residue 239 (M239I), at which a change to 
      valine was known in another family. Phenotypic expression of M239I was highly
      variable, with disease onset between age 44 and 58 years, and two nonaffected
      mutation carriers at age 58 and 68 years. The data showed no influence of APOE
      but were compatible with other possible genetic modifiers of the phenotype or
      penetrance of M239I.

TI  - Do obese inner-city children with asthma have more symptoms than nonobese
      children with asthma?
PG  - 1436-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether obesity is associated with decreased peak expiratory
      flow rates (PEFR), increased asthma symptoms, and increased health service use.
      DESIGN/METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional convenience
      sample. SETTING: Emergency departments (EDs) and primary care clinics in 8
      inner-city areas in 7 cities. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand three hundred twenty-two
      children aged 4 to 9 years with asthma. MEASURES: Obesity was defined as a body
      mass index (BMI, weight/height(2)) >95th percentile. Nonobese children were those
      with a BMI between the 5th and 95th percentile. Underweight children with a BMI
      <5th percentile were eliminated from the study. Demographic and anthropometric
      data were obtained during a baseline interview with the primary caretaker and the
      child. Symptoms, health service use data and measurements of PEFR were obtained
      by parental report during the baseline interview and at 3-month intervals by
      telephone interview over the following 9-month period. RESULTS: Obese (n = 249)
      and nonobese (n = 1073) children did not differ in terms of age, gender, family
      income, passive smoke exposure, caretaker's mental health, and skin test
      reactivity to indoor allergens. Obese children were more often Latino (28% vs
      17%) and, in the 3 months before the baseline interview, were more likely to have
      used oral steroids (30% vs 24%). There were no differences between groups in
      terms of baseline PEFR scores. During the 9 months after baseline assessment, the
      obese group had a higher mean number of days of wheeze per 2-week period (4.0 vs 
      3.4), and a greater proportion of obese individuals had unscheduled ED visits
      (39% vs 31%). There were no differences between the groups in terms of frequency 
      of hospitalization, or in nocturnal awakening. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample of
      inner-city children with asthma, obese children used more medicine, wheezed more,
      and a greater proportion had unscheduled ED visits than the nonobese children.

TI  - Attempting suppression of traumatic memories over extended periods in acute
      stress disorder.
PG  - 899-907
AB  - This study investigated the influence of attempted suppression and thought
      control strategies on traumatic memories. Survivors of civilian trauma with acute
      stress disorder (ASD; n = 20) and without ASD (n = 20) monitored their
      trauma-related thoughts for three 24-h periods. In period 1, participants were
      instructed to think about anything. In period 2, participants were administered
      suppression or nonsuppression instructions relating to thoughts of the trauma. In
      period 3, participants were again instructed to think about anything. The results
      revealed no evidence for an increase in trauma-related thoughts following
      suppression instructions. Punishment and worry thought control strategies
      correlated significantly with both anxiety and suppression ratings. Frequency of 
      intrusions was associated with a distraction cognitive strategy. These findings
      point to the importance of traumatised individuals' cognitive strategies in
      mediating the management and occurrence of posttraumatic intrusions.

TI  - Natural disasters and service delivery to individuals with severe mental
      illness--ice storm 1998.
PG  - 383-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the responses of individuals with severe
      mental illness (SMI) to natural disasters, to describe the impact of the 1998 Ice
      Storm on a group of SMI patients, and to describe the steps taken at a Canadian
      university teaching hospital to ensure the ongoing provision of mental health
      services throughout the crisis. METHOD: Published articles describing the impact 
      of natural disasters on SMI populations, as well as service provision to these
      patients, are reviewed. Service use at the Montreal General Hospital (MGH)
      Department of Psychiatry is described. A questionnaire about the impact of the
      ice storm was administered to a group of patients in an assertive community
      treatment program. RESULTS: Service use during this natural disaster was
      consistent with that described in the literature, in that these patients were no 
      more likely to be admitted or to visit the emergency room during the crisis.
      Continuous mental health service delivery may have contributed to this positive
      outcome. This service delivery was provided by ensuring staff access to
      information, by securing the physical safety of both staff and patients, and by
      taking a flexible, outreach-oriented approach to service delivery. CONCLUSIONS:
      SMI patients who have ongoing access to psychiatric services in disaster
      situations tend to cope well. A flexible, proactive, assertive approach to
      service delivery during the crisis situation will help to ensure that needs for
      care will be met.

      performed, and the presence or absence of the adhesio interthalamica was
      determined for each subject. The length and volume of the third ventricle were
      also measured. RESULTS: No differences in the presence or absence of the adhesio 
      interthalamica were found between patients with schizophrenia and normal
      comparison subjects. Patients without the adhesio interthalamica had
      significantly higher scores for negative symptoms than patients with the adhesio 
      interthalamica. There was no correlation between absence of the adhesio
      interthalamica and length and volume of the third ventricle in either patients or
      comparison subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that patients with
      schizophrenia who do not have the adhesio interthalamica are characterized by
      more severe negative symptoms.

TI  - Manganese intoxication.
PG  - 597-9
AB  - Manganese plays an important role as a cofactor in many enzymatic reactions in
      humans but in excess amounts can cause irreversible nervous system damage.
      Although manganism is a rare condition, it can be the cause of complex nervous
      system symptoms, especially in the setting of environmental exposure.
      Specifically, manganese is a well-known cause of dystonic parkinsonism. This
      article highlights several historical descriptions of the clinical
      manifestations, pathological changes, and attempted therapeutic intervention in
      manganese intoxication.

TI  - Prevention of hip fracture in elderly people with use of a hip protector.
PG  - 1506-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hip fractures are common in frail elderly adults worldwide. We
      investigated the effect of an anatomically designed external hip protector on the
      risk of these age-related fractures. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1801
      ambulatory but frail elderly adults (1409 women and 392 men; mean age, 82 years),
      in a 1:2 ratio, either to a group that wore a hip protector or to a control
      group. Fractures of the hip and all other fractures were recorded until the end
      of the first full month after 62 hip fractures had occurred in the control group.
      The risk of fracture in the two groups was compared, and in the hip-protector
      group the risk of fracture was also analyzed according to whether the protector
      had been in use at the time of a fall. RESULTS: During follow-up, 13 subjects in 
      the hip-protector group had a hip fracture, as compared with 67 subjects in the
      control group. The respective rates of hip fracture were 21.3 and 46.0 per 1000
      person-years (relative hazard in the hip-protector group, 0.4; 95 percent
      confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8; P=0.008). The risk of pelvic fracture was
      slightly but not significantly lower in the hip-protector group than in the
      control group (2 subjects and 12 subjects, respectively, had pelvic fracture)
      (relative hazard, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 1.8; P > or =
      0.05). The risk of other fractures was similar in the two groups. In the
      hip-protector group, four subjects had a hip fracture (among 1034 falls) while
      wearing the protector, and nine subjects had a hip fracture (among 370 falls)
      while not wearing the protector (relative hazard, 0.2; 95 percent confidence
      interval, 0.05 to 0.5; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hip fracture can be
      reduced in frail elderly adults by the use of an anatomically designed external
      hip protector.

TI  - Lengthening the greater saphenous vein with the use of the lateral femoral
      cutaneous vein.
PG  - 819-20
AB  - Besides quality, the length of the greater saphenous vein dictates the
      feasibility of vein bypass grafts in femorodistal popliteal or tibial
      revascularization. A simple and effective technique of lengthening the greater
      saphenous vein is described that allows the use of the laterofemoral cutaneous
      vein in continuity. This technique can be applied when the distal segment of the 
      greater saphenous vein is inadequate or unavailable.

TI  - Quality of dyspnea in bronchoconstriction differs from external resistive loads.
PG  - 451-5
AB  - To test the hypothesis that patients perceive the same quality of dyspnea during 
      mild bronchoconstriction and external resistive loads, we studied subjects with
      asthma under two conditions: (1) during methacholine bronchoprovocation to mimic 
      the bronchospasm of mild asthma and (2) while breathing on a circuit to which was
      added a range of external resistors to mimic the mechanical load of mild asthma. 
      During each of these stimuli, respiratory variables, overall dyspnea intensity on
      a modified Borg scale, and the qualitative descriptors of breathlessness from a
      19-item questionnaire were assessed. The "chest tightness" and "constriction"
      responses were significantly more frequent in the methacholine trials as compared
      with the external load trials (p < 0.0001). The "chest tightness" or
      "constriction" response was chosen during 92% of the 26 trials of methacholine
      bronchoconstriction compared with 3% of the 72 trials of breathing against the
      external resistors. Changes in functional residual capacity were not
      significantly different between the two conditions. We conclude that in mild
      asthma, the sensation of chest tightness is distinct from the sensation of work
      and effort and is not attributable to the mechanical load imposed on the
      respiratory system.

TI  - Physical morbidity in a psychiatric population in Nigeria.
PG  - 195-9
AB  - The rate of physical morbidity amongst 191 psychiatric in-patients in a Nigerian 
      general hospital was found to be 27.2%. Older psychiatric patients were observed 
      to be significantly more likely to suffer from physical morbidity. Infective
      processes constituted 57.7% of the physical health problems identified in the
      study population. Organ systems most frequently involved were the central nervous
      system (mainly as acute organic brain syndrome from septicaemia) (28.9%),
      cardiovascular/haematological (19.2%), and gastrointestinal (17.3%). Over 70% of 
      physical disorders remained undiagnosed by the referring sources. It is
      emphasized that adequate attention should be paid to the physical status of
      psychiatric patients (both new and old cases) at all levels of health care.
      Collaborative work between medicine and psychiatry should also be encouraged in
      developing countries, and this should extend beyond clinical services and
      training (undergraduate and postgraduate) into the areas of evaluative research.

TI  - Giant pelvic retroperitoneal liposarcoma.
PG  - 1002-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic retroperitoneal liposarcomas are rare in young women (under 30
      years old). We present a case of a giant well-differentiated liposarcoma of the
      retroperitoneum in a young woman. CASE: A 27-year-old nulligravida presented with
      rapid abdominal enlargement. Pelvic examination found a huge mass extending from 
      the left adnexa to the epigastric region. At surgery, the pelvic organs were
      displaced to the right side by a retroperitoneal mass that marginally involved
      the left fallopian tube. The left ovary, uterus, and right adnexa were not
      involved and were not removed. No adjuvant irradiation was given. The patient was
      alive and well 2 years after the operation and was 23 weeks pregnant. CONCLUSION:
      Gynecologists should be familiar with pelvic retroperitoneal liposarcomas and
      their treatment.

TI  - Relation of the therapeutic alliance with outcome and other variables: a
      meta-analytic review.
PG  - 438-50
AB  - To identify underlying patterns in the alliance literature, an empirical review
      of the many existing studies that relate alliance to outcome was conducted. After
      an exhaustive literature review, the data from 79 studies (58 published, 21
      unpublished) were aggregated using meta-analytic procedures. The results of the
      meta-analysis indicate that the overall relation of therapeutic alliance with
      outcome is moderate, but consistent, regardless of many of the variables that
      have been posited to influence this relationship. For patient, therapist, and
      observer ratings, the various alliance scales have adequate reliability. Across
      most alliance scales, there seems to be no difference in the ability of raters to
      predict outcome. Moreover, the relation of alliance and outcome does not appear
      to be influenced by other moderator variables, such as the type of outcome
      measure used in the study, the type of outcome rater, the time of alliance
      assessment, the type of alliance rater, the type of treatment provided, or the
      publication status of the study.

TI  - Halo vest effect on balance.
PG  - 255-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of a halo vest, a cervical orthosis, on
      clinically relevant balance parameters. DESIGN: Subjects performed unipedal
      stance (with eyes open and closed, on both firm and soft surfaces) and functional
      reach, with and without the application of a halo vest. SUBJECTS: A convenience
      sample of 12 healthy young subjects, with an equal number of men and women.
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Seconds for unipedal stance (maximum 45); inches for functional
      reach. RESULTS: Both unipedal stance times and functional reach (mean +/-
      standard deviation) were significantly decreased with the halo vest as compared
      to without it (29.1+/-5.8 vs. 32.8+/-6.4 seconds, p = .002; 12.9+/-1.4 vs.
      15.1+/-2.1 inches, p<.01). CONCLUSION: A halo vest causes an acute impairment in 
      balance in the healthy young. It is likely that the impairment would be greater
      in older or injured patients, thus increasing their risk for a fall, which could 
      have devastating consequences.

TI  - Introduction to the special section on stepped care models in psychotherapy.
PG  - 547-8
AB  - Not all patients need the same type and intensity of intervention. Some may be
      helped greatly by reading a self-help book, watching an instructional video, or
      using a computer program. Others could benefit from a brief psychoeducational
      group conducted by a paraprofessional, and still others may require long-term
      individual treatment from a highly trained professional therapist with
      specialized expertise. In an environment of limited resources, it makes sense to 
      provide all the time, expertise, and individual attention a patient needs, but
      not more. Stepped care models represent attempts to maximize the effectiveness
      and efficiency of decisions about allocation of resources in therapy. This
      article introduces a special section addressing these resource allocation issues 
      in the context of prevalent disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic 
      disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol dependence) for which empirically
      supported psychosocial treatments are available.

TI  - Propranolol in primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding among
      cirrhotics in India: a hemodynamic evaluation.
PG  - 2023-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we attempted to complete the hemodynamic
      assessment of propranolol response in cirrhotics with esophageal varices at high 
      risk of bleeding, in one sitting, so as to identify nonresponders at the
      earliest. Some noninvasive indicators of this response were also evaluated.
      METHODS: Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was measured in 33 such cases
      (18 nonbleeders, 15 bleeders) before and 90 min after an oral dose of 80 mg
      propranolol, and reduction by > or =20% taken as responder. RESULTS: Twenty-two
      patients (66.67%) responded (HVPG reduction > or =26%), whereas 11 (33.33%) did
      not (HVPG reduction < or =6%). Postdrug HVPG between responders and nonresponders
      showed a significant difference (p < 0.001). Neither baseline HVPG (p > 0.1),
      baseline CI (p = 0.665), nor baseline stroke volume index (p > 0.1) could predict
      responder status. Difference of HVPG reduction (percent) between bleeders (21.49 
      +/- 35.53) and nonbleeders (40.58 +/- 23.95) approached, but did not reach,
      statistical significance (p = 0.076). However, logistic regression showed this
      difference to be significant (p = 0.026). Age of responders was found to be
      significantly lower than that of nonresponders (p approximately equals 0.05).
      During a follow-up of 9-38 months, only one of 22 responders (on propranolol) had
      an episode of variceal bleed. None in whom HVPG fell to < or = 12 mm Hg bled.
      CONCLUSION: The study suggests that single-sitting hemodynamic assessment of
      acute response to high-dose oral propranolol clearly differentiates between
      responders and nonresponders. Moreover, it appears that prior history of variceal
      bleeding and old age negatively influences the effect of propranolol.

TI  - Natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: probability of and risk
      factors for aneurysm rupture.
PG  - 379-87
AB  - OBJECT: The authors conducted a study to investigate the long-term natural
      history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and the predictive risk factors
      determining subsequent rupture in a patient population in which surgical
      selection of cases was not performed. METHODS: One hundred forty-two patients
      with 181 unruptured aneurysms were followed from the 1950s until death or the
      occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or until the years 1997 to 1998. The annual
      and cumulative incidence of aneurysm rupture as well as several potential risk
      factors predictive of rupture were studied using lifetable analyses and Cox's
      proportional hazards regression models including time-dependent covariates. The
      median follow-up time was 19.7 years (range 0.8-38.9 years). During 2575
      person-years of follow up, there were 33 first-time episodes of hemorrhage from
      previously unruptured aneurysms, for an average annual incidence of 1.3%. In 17
      patients, hemorrhage led to death. The cumulative rate of bleeding was 10.5% at
      10 years, 23% at 20 years, and 30.3% at 30 years after diagnosis. The diameter of
      the unruptured aneurysm (relative risk [RR] 1.11 per mm in diameter, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 1-1.23, p = 0.05) and patient age at diagnosis inversely
      (RR 0.97 per year, 95% CI 0.93-1, p = 0.05) were significant independent
      predictors for a subsequent aneurysm rupture after adjustment for sex,
      hypertension, and aneurysm group. Active smoking status at the time of diagnosis 
      was a significant risk factor for aneurysm rupture (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04-2.06, p 
      = 0.033) after adjustment for size of the aneurysm, patient age, sex, presence of
      hypertension, and aneurysm group. Active smoking status as a time-dependent
      covariate was an even more significant risk factor for aneurysm rupture (adjusted
      RR 3.04, 95% CI 1.21-7.66, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking, size of the
      unruptured intracranial aneurysm, and age, inversely, are important factors
      determining risk for subsequent aneurysm rupture. The authors conclude that such 
      unruptured aneurysms should be surgically treated regardless of their size and of
      a patient's smoking status, especially in young and middle-aged adults, if this
      is technically possible and if the patient's concurrent diseases are not
      contraindications. Cessation of smoking may also be a good alternative to surgery
      in older patients with small-sized aneurysms.

TI  - The relationship between airways inflammation and asthma severity.
PG  - 9-16
AB  - In order to investigate the relationship between airways inflammation and disease
      severity, and improve the understanding of persistent asthma, 74 asthmatics, with
      disease severity ranging from intermittent, to mild to moderate and severe
      persistent (classified according to the Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA]
      guidelines), and 22 nonatopic control subjects were studied using the method of
      induced sputum. Sputum was analyzed for total and differential cell counts
      concentrations of albumin, and levels of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP),
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), and tryptase, inflammatory mediators reflecting
      eosinophil, neutrophil, and mast cell activation. Asthma severity (assessed by
      FEV(1), peak expiratory flow [PEF] variability, and daily symptom scores) and
      methacholine airways responsiveness were related to sputum eosinophilia and ECP. 
      In addition, sputum neutrophilia and MPO levels correlated, albeit weakly, with
      PEF variability and symptom scores, respectively. Tryptase concentrations were
      raised in mild to moderate asthmatics. Albumin concentrations were significantly 
      raised across the spectrum of asthma severity and correlated with those of
      tryptase and ECP. Despite treatment with either high doses of inhaled
      corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids, prominent eosinophilic inflammation with
      raised ECP was noted. This study points to persistent, disease severity-related
      airways inflammation in asthma, involving eosinophils, mast cells, and
      neutrophils, which is evident despite treatment with corticosteroids.

TI  - Chronically occluded inferior venae cavae: endovascular treatment.
PG  - 133-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the results of endoluminal recanalization and stent placement 
      in patients with chronic occlusions of the inferior vena cava (IVC). MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Seventeen consecutive patients (12 male, five female patients; mean 
      age, 40.6 years; age range, 15-77 years) with chronic IVC occlusions were treated
      during a 6-year period. The mean duration of symptoms was 32 months. Underlying
      active malignancy was the cause of occlusion in four patients. Five patients with
      superimposed acute thrombus underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis prior to IVC
      recanalization. Clinical patency was defined as absence or improvement of
      symptoms. Clinical follow-up was supplemented with ultrasonography, vena
      cavography, or both in 10 patients. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 15
      (88%) patients. Additional thrombolytic therapy and stent placement was needed in
      two patients to maintain patency at 4 and 6 months after the procedure. Twelve
      patients had IVCs that remained patent after a mean follow-up of 19 months for a 
      primary patency rate of 80%. The primary assisted patency rate was 87% (13 of
      15). There were four deaths owing to underlying disease 6-21 months after the
      procedures. There were no procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION:
      Endoluminal recanalization and stent placement in chronically occluded IVCs has a
      good intermediate-term outcome and should be considered in patients who have
      symptoms and who often do not have adequate alternative therapy.

TI  - Failure of treatment with cephalexin for Lyme disease.
PG  - 563-7
AB  - CONTEXT: Lyme disease typically presents with a skin lesion called erythema
      migrans (EM), which though often distinctive in appearance may be confused with
      cellulitis. The first-generation cephalosporin, cephalexin monohydrate, is
      effective for treating bacterial cellulitis but has not been recommended or
      studied for treating Lyme disease because of poor in vitro activity. OBJECTIVE:
      To describe the outcome of patients with EM who were treated with cephalexin.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients presenting with EM to the Lyme Disease Diagnostic 
      Center in Westchester, NY (May 1992-September 1997). A 2-mm punch biopsy specimen
      of the leading edge of the EM lesion and/or blood was cultured for Borrelia
      burgdorferi. RESULTS: Eleven (2.8%) of 393 study patients had been initially
      treated with cephalexin prior to our evaluation; 9 (82%) were originally
      diagnosed with cellulitis. Cephalexin was administered for 8.6 days (range, 2-21 
      days) prior to presentation. All 11 patients had clinical evidence of disease
      progression, including 8 whose rash enlarged, 2 who developed seventh-nerve palsy
      (1 with new EM lesions), and 1 who developed new EM lesions. Borrelia burgdorferi
      grew in cultures from 5 patients despite a mean of 9.8 days of treatment with
      cephalexin (range, 5-21 days). CONCLUSION: Cephalexin should not be used to treat
      early Lyme disease and should be prescribed with caution during the summer months
      for patients believed to have cellulitis in locations where Lyme disease is
      endemic.

TI  - Endotoxin-induced mortality is related to increased oxidative stress and
      end-organ dysfunction, not refractory hypotension, in heme oxygenase-1-deficient 
      mice.
PG  - 3015-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is an enzyme that degrades heme to generate CO 
      (a vasodilatory gas), iron, and the potent antioxidant bilirubin. A disease
      process characterized by decreases in vascular tone and increases in oxidative
      stress is endotoxic shock. Moreover, HO-1 is markedly induced in multiple organs 
      after the administration of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) to mice. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: To determine the role of HO-1 in endotoxemia, we administered LPS to
      mice that were wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), or homozygous null (-/-) for 
      targeted disruption of HO-1. LPS produced a similar induction of HO-1 mRNA and
      protein in HO-1(+/+) and HO-1(+/-) mice, whereas HO-1(-/-) mice showed no HO-1
      expression. Four hours after LPS, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased in all 
      the groups. However, SBP was significantly higher in HO-1(-/-) mice (121+/-5 mm
      Hg) after 24 hours, compared with HO-1(+/+) (96+/-7 mm Hg) and HO-1(+/-) (89+/-13
      mm Hg) mice. A sustained increase in endothelin-1 contributed to this SBP
      response. Even though SBP was higher, mortality was increased in HO-1(-/-) mice, 
      and they exhibited hepatic and renal dysfunction that was not present in
      HO-1(+/+) and HO-1(+/-) mice. The end-organ damage and death in HO-1(-/-) mice
      was related to increased oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that
      the increased mortality during endotoxemia in HO-1(-/-) mice is related to
      increased oxidative stress and end-organ (renal and hepatic) damage, not to
      refractory hypotension.

TI  - Cerebral microembolism in acute spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection.
PG  - 1738-40
AB  - The rate and risk factors for early ischemic recurrence in patients with internal
      carotid artery dissection (ICAD) are largely unknown. Serial transcranial Doppler
      (TCD) monitoring of microembolic signals (MES) was performed in 28 consecutive
      patients with acute ICAD. MES were identified in 13 patients, and early ischemic 
      recurrence occurred in 7. Six of 13 patients with MES and 1 of 15 without MES
      experienced early ischemic recurrence (p = 0.029). MES detection on serial TCD
      monitoring may be associated with an increased risk of early ischemic recurrence 
      in patients with acute ICAD.

TI  - The psychological and social functioning of 14 children and 12 adolescents after 
      Ilizarov leg lengthening.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - We studied the psychological and social impact of the Ilizarov leg lengthening
      procedure in 26 patients (aged 6-17 years), who had completed the treatment at
      least 2 months previously. Measurements of depression and anxiety were performed 
      preoperatively and at follow-up. Questions about functioning at school, daily
      life activities and treatment-related experiences were answered by the patient
      and his/her parents. The school or work results showed no significant decline
      during the lengthening procedure. Serious sleeping problems occurred during the
      procedure. There was no subjective improvement in physical skill after the
      procedure and almost one-fourth of the children still had complaints about their 
      leg. We conclude that the Ilizarov procedure caused no serious psychological
      disturbances.

TI  - Does cardioplegia type affect outcome and survival in patients with advanced left
      ventricular dysfunction? Results from the CABG Patch Trial.
PG  - III84-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy regarding which cardioplegic solution,
      temperature, and route of administration provides superior protection. The CABG
      Patch Trial enrolled a high-risk group of coronary artery disease patients with
      an ejection fraction of <36%. Thus, they constitute an ideal group to benefit
      most from optimal cardioplegic protection. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients
      randomized into the trial were compared with respect to the use of blood and
      crystalloid cardioplegia. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to surgeons
      requesting blood cardioplegic temperature and route. Patients receiving
      crystalloid cardioplegia versus those receiving blood cardioplegia were found to 
      have significantly more operative deaths (2% versus 0.3%, P:=0.02), postoperative
      myocardial infarctions (10% versus 2%, P:<0.001), shock (13% versus 7%, P:=0.
      013), and postoperative conduction defects (21.6% versus 12.4%, P:=0. 001).
      Despite this, early death (6% crystalloid versus 4% blood cardioplegia) and late 
      death (24% crystalloid versus 21% blood cardioplegia) statistics were not
      significantly different. Patients receiving normothermic blood had less
      postoperative right ventricular dysfunction (10%) than did patients receiving
      cold blood (25%) or cold blood with warm reperfusion (30%) (P:=0.004). There was 
      no significant difference in early or late death. Finally, patients who received 
      combined antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia had significantly less inotrope
      use (71% versus 84%, P:=0.002), right ventricular dysfunction (23% versus 41%,
      P:=0.001), and postoperative balloon pump use (12% versus 19%, P:=0.02) than did 
      those who received antegrade cardioplegia. There was no difference in survival.
      CONCLUSIONS: Blood cardioplegia and combined antegrade and retrograde
      cardioplegia are superior to crystalloid and antegrade cardioplegia alone for
      postoperative morbidity. Despite this, there is no significant difference in
      early or late survival.

TI  - Neuroanatomical hypothesis of panic disorder, revised.
PG  - 493-505
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a 1989 article, the authors provided a hypothesis for the
      neuroanatomical basis of panic disorder that attempted to explain why both
      medication and cognitive behavioral psychotherapy are effective treatments. Here 
      they revise that hypothesis to consider developments in the preclinical
      understanding of the neurobiology of fear and avoidance. METHOD: The authors
      review recent literature on the phenomenology, neurobiology, and treatment of
      panic disorder and impressive developments in documenting the neuroanatomy of
      conditioned fear in animals. RESULTS: There appears to be a remarkable similarity
      between the physiological and behavioral consequences of response to a
      conditioned fear stimulus and a panic attack. In animals, these responses are
      mediated by a "fear network" in the brain that is centered in the amygdala and
      involves its interaction with the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex.
      Projections from the amygdala to hypothalamic and brainstem sites explain many of
      the observed signs of conditioned fear responses. It is speculated that a similar
      network is involved in panic disorder. A convergence of evidence suggests that
      both heritable factors and stressful life events, particularly in early
      childhood, are responsible for the onset of panic disorder. CONCLUSIONS:
      Medications, particularly those that influence the serotonin system, are
      hypothesized to desensitize the fear network from the level of the amygdala
      through its projects to the hypothalamus and the brainstem. Effective
      psychosocial treatments may also reduce contextual fear and cognitive
      misattributions at the level of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.
      Neuroimaging studies should help clarify whether these hypotheses are correct.

TI  - Prescription of proton pump inhibitors before endoscopy. A potential cause of
      missed diagnosis of early gastric cancers.
PG  - 385-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early gastric cancer is frequently seen with nonspecific dyspeptic
      symptoms and subtle endoscopic features. Treatment at this stage of the disease
      produces a high chance of cure. If the diagnosis is missed at this early stage,
      then the prognosis may be much poorer depending on the subsequent delay in
      reaching a diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To report the healing effect of proton pump
      inhibitors on early gastric cancer. METHODS: This article reports a case series
      of 7 patients with ulcerated early gastric cancers indistinguishable as malignant
      gastric ulcers at endoscopy who were inadvertently prescribed a short course of a
      proton pump inhibitor prior to a second confirmatory endoscopy. The cases studied
      were patients with dyspeptic symptoms referred from primary care physicians for
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. RESULTS: In each case the patient became
      asymptomatic, the endoscopic signs seen at the first endoscopy had resolved, and 
      the lesions could not be recognized even by an experienced endoscopist. If the
      proton pump inhibitors had been prescribed by the referring physician before the 
      first endoscopy, the diagnosis probably would have been missed. These cases
      demonstrate the potentially serious masking effect of prescribing a short course 
      of these drugs before making an endoscopic diagnosis. Even though the patient has
      been referred for endoscopy, the endoscopist may fail to identify the lesion and 
      thus miss the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians must resist the
      pressures to prescribe proton pump inhibitors before endoscopy, particularly in
      patients older than 45 years, if the diagnostic yield of gastric cancer in the
      early curable stages is to be maximized.

TI  - Percutaneous coronary revascularization in elderly patients: impact on functional
      status and quality of life.
PG  - 955-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is frequently performed in
      elderly patients, but little is known about its impact on overall health and
      quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in health-related quality of life 
      among elderly patients after PCI. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: 75 U.S.
      hospitals. PATIENTS: Participants in two clinical trials of PCI. MEASUREMENTS:
      Health-related quality of life was assessed by using the Medical Outcomes Study
      Short Form (SF-36) survey and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire at baseline, 6
      months, and 1 year. RESULTS: Serial data on health-related quality of life were
      available for 295 elderly (> or =70 years) and 1150 nonelderly (<70 years)
      patients. At 6 months, physical health had improved in 51% of elderly patients
      and mental health had improved in 29%. Cardiovascular-specific health status had 
      improved in 58% to 75% of elderly patients. Improvement did not significantly
      differ between elderly and non-elderly patients at 6 months or 1 year.
      CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients selected for participation in a trial of PCI had
      substantial improvements in health-related quality of life after PCI that were
      similar to those in younger patients.

TI  - Health problems in teenage daily smokers versus nonsmokers, Norway, 1995-1997:
      the Nord-Trondelag Health Study.
PG  - 148-55
AB  - Increased morbidity among teenage smokers has been reported, but specific current
      health problems and medication use other than of alcohol and narcotics have
      received less attention. The aim of this study was to examine the association
      between health problems and daily smoking in teenagers. Ninety percent of all
      teenagers attending junior high or high schools participated in a cross-sectional
      study conducted in Nord-Trondelag County, Norway, 1995-1997; included were 8,040 
      students aged 13-18 years. Information on smoking habits, health problems,
      medication use, and use of health services was obtained in schools by
      self-administered questionnaire and by interview. Fifty-five percent of boys and 
      57% of girls had tried smoking, and 9% and 11%, respectively, reported current
      daily smoking. When compared with boys and girls who had never smoked, daily
      smoking among both sexes and all age groups was associated with significantly
      poorer perceived health, respiratory symptoms, headache, neck and shoulder pain, 
      stomachache, nausea, frequent heartbeats, nervousness/restlessness, and sleep
      problems. Daily smokers used more medications and health services. Daily smoking 
      by adolescents is already associated with multiple somatic health problems.
      Whether or not the association is causal, daily smoking identifies a group of
      adolescents with health problems for whom preventive strategies should also
      include medical and social support.

TI  - A comparison of three radiologic scoring systems for the long-term assessment of 
      rheumatoid arthritis: findings of an ongoing prospective inception cohort study
      of 132 women followed up for a median of twelve years.
PG  - 1465-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the sensitivity and efficiency of 3 different radiologic
      scoring systems in measuring radiologic progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
      over a 12-year period. METHODS: Radiographs of the hands and feet of 112 RA
      patients were assessed at 0, 3, 6, and 12 years of disease duration using the
      Sharp score as modified by van der Heijde (SHS), the Sharp score with increased
      maximum scores (Sharp Max), and the Kellgren score. The sensitivity to change was
      tested using the standardized response mean (SRM); the efficiency was determined 
      by calculating the number of patients needed to detect 50% difference in
      progression between 2 patient groups. RESULTS: Radiologic abnormalities were
      steadily progressive irrespective of the scoring method used. In early disease,
      the SRM was significantly larger for the SHS and Kellgren scores compared with
      the Sharp Max score. In late disease, the Kellgren score was slightly more
      sensitive to change compared with the SHS and Sharp Max scores; the difference,
      however, did not reach significance. In erosive disease, the SRM was
      significantly larger for the Kellgren compared with the SHS and Sharp Max scores.
      The numbers of patients needed to detect a 50% difference during the 0-3-year
      followup period were 129, 138, and 124 for the SHS, the Sharp Max, and the
      Kellgren, respectively. The numbers of patients needed to detect a 50% difference
      during the 6-12-year followup period were 117, 121, and 104, respectively. The
      numbers of patients needed to detect a 50% difference during the 6-12-year
      followup in patients with erosive disease were 74, 78, and 68, respectively, for 
      the 3 scores. The Kellgren required 33 minutes to score 10 sets of radiographs of
      the hands and feet; the SHS score took 55 minutes. CONCLUSION: The Kellgren
      scoring system is the most efficient method for monitoring the radiologic
      progression of RA. The Kellgren and the SHS are equally sensitive to change early
      in the disease, whereas the Kellgren score becomes more sensitive to change late 
      in the disease in patients with erosions.

TI  - Placebos: a review of the placebo response.
PG  - 1637-43
AB  - Placebos have been a component of healing since the beginning. Whether
      consciously or unconsciously given, they are largely responsible for the success 
      of medicine before randomized trials. Yet, even in this era of "evidence-based
      medicine," placebos remain enigmatic, and elicit mixed attitudes from divers
      disciplines. However, our ignorance is not total. There are a few facts to cling 
      to and old myths to dispel. The effect of placebos seems to encompass such
      disparate elements as anxiety, conditioning, expectation, the healer's persona,
      and the attachment of meaning to illness. Placebos may obscure as well as
      illuminate the truth about treatment effectiveness. Moreover, it is easy to
      confuse their effect with the natural progression of the disease being treated.
      Those engaged in treatment trials must recognize and manage the reality of
      placebos rather than attempt to eliminate or disparage them. Factors that might
      influence the placebo effect such as age, gender, and social circumstances need
      prospective study. Meanwhile doctors, through honest and compassionate
      interactions with patients, should strive to maximize their treatments' benefits.
      This implies confident reassurance and the provision of some meaning to the
      person's symptoms.

TI  - How mental illness is portrayed in children's television. A prospective study.
PG  - 440-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no published studies concerning the depiction of mental
      illness in children's television programmes. AIMS: To determine whether mental
      illness was depicted in children's television. METHOD: Sample of one complete
      week of children's television (57 hours, 50 minutes; 128 series episodes: 69
      cartoon animations, 12 non-cartoon animations, 47 real life) provided for
      children under the age of 10 years. Disclosure analysis of portrayals of mental
      illness through repeated viewings identified patterns in the use of linguistic,
      semiotic and rhetorical resources. RESULTS: Of the 128 episodes, 59 (46%)
      contained one or more references to mental illness, predominantly in cartoons (n 
      = 47, 80%) compared with other episode types (chi 2 = 17.1, d.f. = 2, P < 0.05). 
      Commonly occurring terms such as 'crazy' (n = 28), 'mad' (n = 19) and 'losing
      your mind' (n = 13) were employed to denote loss of control. The six consistently
      mentally ill characters were almost entirely devoid of admirable attributes.
      CONCLUSION: Young viewers are being socialized into stigmatizing conceptions of
      mental illness.

TI  - Gemcitabine in combination with doxorubicin in advanced breast cancer: final
      results of a phase II pharmacokinetic trial.
PG  - 2545-52
AB  - PURPOSE: Gemcitabine has promising single-agent activity in advanced breast
      disease. The aim of this phase II study was to determine the efficacy, toxicity, 
      and pharmacokinetic profile of gemcitabine administered with doxorubicin as
      first-line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: Of the 42 women with metastatic breast cancer (age 33 to 74 years; mean 
      age, 55 years), 13 were chemotherapy-naive and 29 had received adjuvant
      chemotherapy. Gemcitabine (800 or 1,000 mg/m(2)) and doxorubicin (25 mg/m(2))
      were administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Blood 
      samples were drawn on day 8 of cycles 1, 2, and 3 and of subsequent odd cycles
      for gemcitabine pharmacokinetic determinations and before and after the first
      dose of cycle 1 or 2 for doxorubicin determinations. RESULTS: There were three
      complete and 20 partial responses, for an overall response rate of 55% (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 40% to 70%) and a complete response rate of 7%. The
      median survival time for all 42 patients was 27 months (95% CI, 13.4 to 30.0
      months) and the 1-year survival rate was 80%. Toxicity was mainly hematologic.
      The disposition of both drugs was unchanged when they were administered on the
      same day compared with when they were given singly. CONCLUSION: The combination
      of gemcitabine (800 mg/m(2)) and doxorubicin (25 mg/m(2)) can be safely
      administered using a weekly schedule. The disposition of both drugs is unchanged 
      when they are administered on the same day. This combination shows promising
      activity with acceptable toxicity compared with other combination therapies.

TI  - Chimeric toxins targeted to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope
      glycoprotein augment the in vivo activity of combination antiretroviral therapy
      in thy/liv-SCID-Hu mice.
PG  - 921-6
AB  - Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which combines multiple inhibitors 
      of essential human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enzymes, induces
      dramatic and sustained viral load reductions in many people infected with HIV-1. 
      However, reservoirs of infected cells capable of producing replication-competent 
      virus persist even after years of HAART, preventing elimination of infection.
      CD4-PE40 and 3B3(Fv)-PE38, chimeric toxins designed to target the HIV envelope
      (Env), represent a complementary class of agents that selectively kill
      productively infected cells. To investigate whether these Env-targeted toxins
      might serve as adjuncts to HAART for the elimination of infected cells, we tested
      their ability to augment HAART efficacy in vivo by using a thy/liv SCID-hu mouse 
      model. CD4-PE40 and 3B3(Fv)-PE38 markedly enhanced the capacity of HAART to
      suppress acute HIV-1 infection and improved HAART-mediated viral load reduction
      in mice with established HIV-1 infection. These results represent the first
      demonstration of in vivo anti-HIV-1 efficacy for Env-targeted toxins and support 
      their potential therapeutic utility in combination with HAART.

TI  - Understanding the heterogeneity of depression through the triad of symptoms,
      course and risk factors: a longitudinal, population-based study.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing research effort to test if depression is a
      homogeneous clinical syndrome and to identify valid and useful subtypes based on 
      the number and nature of depressive symptoms. This study summarizes the patterns 
      of depressive symptoms evident in a prospective study of the general population
      and examines the validity of potential subtypes by studying their course and
      etiologic heterogeneity. METHODS: A general population sample of 1920 adults
      (aged 18-96) from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) follow-up
      study (1981 to 1993/6) were examined. Data on diagnoses, symptoms, course and
      risk factors were collected using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS). Latent
      class analysis was applied to summarize symptom patterns. Course characteristics 
      and risk factor profiles were compared among potential subtypes based on the
      number of symptom groups or symptom patterns. Logistic regression models were
      used to examine the etiologic heterogeneity among potential subtypes based on
      symptoms. RESULTS: The number of symptom groups gave the most efficient insight
      into differential etiologic processes. Severe depression (7-9 symptom groups) was
      associated with female gender, family history of depression but not with
      stressful life events before the onset of the first episode. Moderate (5-6
      symptom groups) and mild depression (3-4 symptom groups) were associated with
      family history of depression, stressful life events before the onset, but not
      with female gender. The latent class model generated patterns of depressive
      psychopathology as follows: anhedonia, suicidal, psychomotor, and severely
      depressed subtypes. The Anhedonia subtype showed a course and risk factor profile
      distinct from the others. LIMITATIONS: The measurement of psychopathology was
      based on self-reported DIS interviews instead of psychiatric assessments. Recall 
      or report bias cannot be excluded in the ascertainment of family history and
      stressful life events. CONCLUSIONS: Depression is heterogeneous, even below the
      threshold of syndromal diagnosis. The severity of an episode appears to be more
      informative than the pattern of symptoms, with the possible exception of a
      putative anhedonic subtype.

TI  - Femoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe
      reimplantation response after lung transplantation.
PG  - 559-61
AB  - Severe pulmonary reimplantation response after lung transplantation is not very
      common, although the mortality can be high. We present a patient who developed an
      extremely severe reperfusion injury after bilateral lung transplantation. Because
      of severe hypoxia and hemodynamic instability, despite aggressive ventilator
      settings, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was instituted 
      using the femoral approach at the bedside. During ECMO, the patient developed a
      thoracic wall hematoma that was treated with transfusion alone. After 50 h of
      ECMO, his chest radiograph had dramatically improved, his oxygen need had been
      reduced to 50%, and he was successfully weaned from ECMO. Two years later, he is 
      doing extremely well. Therefore, institution of ECMO using the femoral approach
      can be performed safely at the bedside in the ICU, and can be lifesaving in the
      context of a very severe reimplantation response after lung transplantation.

TI  - Immunoglobulin adsorption in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 385-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) frequently is a progressive
      disease without causative therapy options. Following the hypothesis that in
      certain patients autoantibodies against cardiac structures may induce, maintain, 
      or promote the progression of the disease, we investigated whether the
      elimination of these autoantibodies through immunoadsorption would improve
      cardiac function. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective case-control study
      included 34 patients with IDC. Each patient presented with moderate to severe
      heart failure and evidence of autoantibodies directed against
      beta(1)-adrenoceptors (beta(1)-AABs). Seventeen patients received standard
      medical therapy (control group), whereas 17 were also treated with
      immunoadsorption (treatment group) to eliminate beta(1)-AABs. A 1-year follow-up 
      included echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction and
      internal diameters, beta(1)-AAB levels, and clinical status every 3 months.
      Within 1 year, the mean+/-SD left ventricular ejection fraction rose from
      22.3+/-3.3% to 37.9+/-7.9% (P=0.0001) in the treatment group, with a relative
      increase of 69.9%. However, in the control group, no overall increase was seen
      (from 23.8+/-3.0% to 25.2+/-5.9%, P=0. 3154). Left ventricular diameter in
      diastole decreased by 14.5% from 74.5+/-7.1 to 63.7+/-6.0 mm in the treatment
      group (P=0.0001) and by 3.8% (P=0.2342) in the control group. In the treatment
      group, the NYHA functional rating improved after immunoadsorption (P=0.0001).
      beta(1)-AABs did not increase anew. CONCLUSIONS: In IDC, the use of
      immunoadsorption is superior to the use of standard medical therapy. It
      significantly improves cardiac performance and clinical status.

TI  - Psychotropic medication use in patients with epilepsy: effect on seizure
      frequency.
PG  - 458-64
AB  - Physicians are often reluctant to use psychotropic medications in epilepsy
      patients with psychiatric disorders because of concern over the potential risk
      for lowering seizure threshold. This study assesses retrospectively the impact of
      psychotropic medications on seizure frequency in 57 patients seen consecutively
      at an epilepsy center. During psychotropic drug therapy, seizure frequency
      decreased in 33% of patients, was unchanged in 44%, and increased in 23%. Mean
      seizure frequency was not statistically different between pre-treatment and
      treatment periods (t = 0.23, df = 56). Simultaneous adjustments in antiepileptic 
      drug regimen could not account for the findings. Results support the position
      that psychotropic medications, introduced slowly in low to moderate doses, can be
      safely used in epilepsy patients with comorbid psychiatric pathology during the
      regular course of clinical care.

TI  - Long term effect of alpha interferon in children with chronic hepatitis B.
PG  - 715-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of this study was to better define the long term
      prognosis of infection and disease in children with chronic hepatitis B treated
      with interferon (IFN) alpha. PATIENTS: A total of 107 children with chronic
      hepatitis B who received IFN alpha for three or six months in two clinical trials
      were followed for a mean period of 69 (17) months. Response to treatment was
      defined as loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) within 12 months after stopping 
      treatment. A control group of 59 patients was also followed for a shorter mean
      time (46 (19) months). RESULTS: Sixteen (15%) treated children responded during
      therapy and 18 (17%) during post-treatment follow up; 31 (29%) non-responders
      lost HBeAg during subsequent years. High pretreatment levels of transaminases and
      a greater histological activity index were predictors of response. Kaplan-Meier
      estimates of cumulative HBeAg clearance rates at five years were similar between 
      treated patients (60%) and controls (65%). After HBeAg clearance, all cases lost 
      hepatitis B virus DNA and 94% had normal transaminase levels. Loss of hepatitis B
      surface antigen (HBsAg) occurred in four (25%) patients who responded during
      treatment but in none of the other treated or untreated patients. CONCLUSIONS:
      After five years' observation, the proportion of treated children with sustained 
      HBeAg clearance comprised an equal number of responders and non-responders and
      did not differ from that observed in untreated controls, suggesting that IFN
      simply accelerated a spontaneous event. However, IFN significantly improved the
      rate of HBsAg loss in cases with more prominent disease activity who were early
      responders, and may be particularly useful in this type of patient.

TI  - Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI): A collaboration between research
      and clinical practice.
PG  - I17-25
AB  - This article provides an overview of the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative 
      (QUERI), an ambitious attempt to develop a data-driven national
      quality-improvement program for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) that is 
      fully integrated within VHA's Strategic Framework for Quality Management, as
      discussed elsewhere in this supplement. QUERI is designed to ensure the
      systematic translation of findings and products (quality tools that promote use
      of research findings) to promote optimal patient outcomes and system-wide
      improvements. In developing QUERI, a framework was created to integrate
      structural elements (organizational characteristics) and process considerations
      (those actions and action sequences associated with positive change) with
      outcomes (both at the patient level and at the systems level). In developing this
      framework, a process for translation of evidence into action was born. The QUERI 
      process depends on having or discovering accurate information about what services
      are needed, who needs them, how they should be provided, and relevant outcomes
      and costs. This article describes the 6-step QUERI process and presents an
      overview of relevant programmatic details, including QUERI's rigorous review
      process, and VHA's unique qualifications for establishing a national model for
      quality improvement.

TI  - Genital tract human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) shedding and

PG  - 555-63
AB  - This study sought to identify genital tract characteristics associated with
      vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 DNA
      and RNA, HIV-1 env diversity, and inflammatory cells were quantified in
      cervicovaginal lavages (CVLs) of 24 women enrolled in the Women and Infants
      Transmission Study; 7 women transmitted HIV-1 perinatally. Vaginal candidiasis,
      HIV-1 culture positivity, levels of HIV-1 DNA and cell-free RNA, and HIV-1 env
      diversity were significantly higher in the CVLs of transmitters. CVL HIV-1 DNA
      levels correlated with higher levels of inflammatory cells and cell-free HIV-1
      RNA. Of subjects with paired blood and CVL specimens, there was more HIV-1 env
      heterogeneity between blood and CVLs in transmitters than in nontransmitters. In 
      summary, increased HIV-1 shedding is correlated with a more complex population of
      HIV-1 quasispecies in the genital tracts of parturient women, which may increase 
      the probability that a fetotropic strain is transmitted.

TI  - Combined assessment of T-wave alternans and late potentials used to predict
      arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction. A prospective study.
PG  - 722-30
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine whether the combination
      of two markers that reflect depolarization and repolarization abnormalities can
      predict future arrhythmic events after acute myocardial infarction (MI).
      BACKGROUND: Although various noninvasive markers have been used to predict
      arrhythmic events after MI, the positive predictive value of the markers remains 
      low. METHODS: We prospectively assessed T-wave alternans (TWA) and late
      potentials (LP) by signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) and ejection fraction 
      (EF) in 102 patients with successful determination results after acute MI. The
      TWA was analyzed using the power-spectral method during supine bicycle exercise
      testing. No antiarrhythmic drugs were used during the follow-up period. The study
      end point was the documentation of ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS: The TWA was 
      present in 50 patients (49%), LP present in 21 patients (21%), and an EF <40% in 
      28 patients (27%). During a follow-up period of 13 +/- 6 months, symptomatic,
      sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation occurred in 15
      patients (15%). The event rates were significantly higher in patients with TWA,
      LP, or an abnormal EF. The sensitivity and the negative predictive value of TWA
      in predicting arrhythmic events were very high (93% and 98%, respectively),
      whereas its positive predictive value (28%) was lower than those for LP and EF.
      The highest positive predictive value (50%) was obtained when TWA and LP were
      combined. CONCLUSIONS: The combined assessment of TWA and LP was associated with 
      a high positive predictive value for an arrhythmic event after acute MI.
      Therefore, it could be a useful index to identify patients at high risk of
      arrhythmic events.

TI  - Tracking the use and impact of a community social report: where does the
      information go?
PG  - 41-5
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to report on a study evaluating the extent to which 
      a social report (entitled "Hamilton-Wentworth Profile on Children and Youth") was
      read and used by recipients. Subjects were divided into two groups: an Active
      Group which had worked on producing the Profile and/or requested copies of it
      once it had been released, and a Passive Group which had received copies of the
      Profile through a general mailing list used for other research reports.
      Approximately one year later, 90% of the Active Group recalled the Profile
      compared to 21% of the Passive Group. Similarly, 83% of Active Group respondents 
      had read the Profile compared to 8% of Passive Group subjects. 80% of Active
      Group respondents and 5% of Passive Group respondents used the Profile. The
      results suggest that if social reports are read by local community agencies and
      individuals, they will be used to help improve conditions for children and youth.
      Social reports at the local level are more likely to be read if potential users
      are engaged in the process of report production and if the reports are
      disseminated to the appropriate target audience.

TI  - Differential Th1/Th2 cytokine patterns in chronic arthritis: interferon gamma is 
      highly expressed in synovium of rheumatoid arthritis compared with seronegative
      spondyloarthropathies.
PG  - 263-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible differences in Th1 and Th2 cytokine mRNA
      expression in the synovial tissue (ST) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      and seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA) with diagnostic and/or pathogenic
      interest. METHODS: Eleven RA patients and 14 SpA patients (10 with
      undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy (USpA), two with ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
      and two with psoriatic arthritis (PsA)) were included. Th1 (interferon gamma,
      interleukin 2) and Th2 (interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10) cytokine
      mRNA levels from arthritic knee ST were quantified by using an optimised
      polymerase chain reaction method with a computerised analysis system. Protein
      levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1, tumour necrosis factor alpha 
      and interleukin 6) in synovial fluid were quantified with a specific ELISA test. 
      RESULTS: Th1 cytokines were detected in all of RA ST samples in contrast with 58%
      (interferon gamma) and 71% (interleukin 2) of SpA samples. Th2 cytokines were
      expressed in 90% of RA ST samples, but the findings in SpA were interleukin 10 in
      90%, interleukin 4 in 60% and interleukin 5 in 40% of ST samples. However, when
      the mRNA levels of each cytokine were quantified and corrected for T cell mRNA
      levels, only interferon gamma levels were significantly higher in RA than in SpA 
      (p<0.003). Thus, the Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio in RA was fivefold that of SpA.
      Synovial fluid interleukin 1beta concentrations were higher in RA than in SpA
      (p<0. 05); there were also higher synovial fluid levels of tumour necrosis factor
      alpha in RA than in SpA, but without statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This
      study has detected both Th1 and Th2 cytokine gene expression in ST from RA and
      SpA patients. Synovium interferon gamma mRNA levels and SF interleukin 1beta
      protein levels were significantly higher in RA than in SpA, so reflecting the
      known proinflammatory activity of interferon gamma through macrophage activation.
      Thus, the Th1 (interferon gamma)/Th2 (interleukin 4) ratio is significantly
      higher in RA than in SpA ST. These data confirm previous studies on ST Th1/Th2
      balance in RA and extend previous work in comparing ST RA with subgroups of SpA
      distinct of ReA.

TI  - Body temperature of newborns: what is normal?
PG  - 503-10
AB  - Medical records of 203 healthy full-term infants were reviewed to determine the
      range of axillary temperatures for newborn infants, factors that affect
      temperature and nursery management of infants with temperatures outside published
      normal ranges. The mean birth temperature was 36.5 degrees C (S.D. = 0.6 degrees 
      C). Temperature was associated with birth weight (p<0.0005) and the presence of
      maternal fever (p<0.0001) but not with type of environment or time of birth. The 
      mean temperature increased with age, rising 0.2 degrees C by 2-3 hours after
      birth (p<0.0001) and 0.3 degrees C by 15-20 hours (p<0.0001). Among a subset of
      114 eligible neonates the mean temperature dropped 0.2 degrees C after bathing
      (p<0.0001). Although 17% of all temperatures measured were in the hypothermic (< 
      or =36.3 degrees C) range, the only response recorded by nursery staff consisted 
      of warming by modifying the environment, e.g., bundling. Blood cultures were
      drawn from 51 infants (25%), 43 because of maternal intrapartum antibiotic
      treatment for maternal fever or prolonged duration of ruptured amniotic membranes
      (>24 hours) and none for evaluation of abnormal temperatures. No infants had
      systemic infections and all were discharged in stable condition. Newborn axillary
      temperatures in our nursery were considerably lower than what has been previously
      described as "normal." Given the frequency of "hypothermia" and absence of
      associated illness, we believe the reference range for newborn temperatures
      should be expanded to include lower temperatures.

TI  - Late presentation of ureteral injury after laparoscopic surgery.
PG  - 337-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical presentation, etiology, and treatment of ureteral
      injuries recognized late in women who had gynecologic laparoscopies. METHODS: We 
      reviewed the charts of 12 women who had delayed recognition of ureteral injuries 
      between January 1991 and December 1998. RESULTS: Patients presented with fever,
      hematuria, flank pain, or peritonitis between 3 and 33 days postoperatively. The 
      mechanism of ureteral injuries was electrocoagulation in seven women, laser
      ablation in one, and stapler ligation in four. The sites of injury were near the 
      inferior margin of the sacroiliac joint on excretory urogram in eight women and
      near the ureterovesical junction in four. Three women initially treated with
      internal ureteral stents were subsequently treated with ureteroneocystostomy
      because of progression of urinary ascites in two and a delayed ureteral stricture
      in one. In nine patients, attempts at ureteral stenting were unsuccessful and
      immediate ureteral reconstruction was done. Outcomes were good in all cases.
      CONCLUSION: Delayed recognition of ureteral injury after gynecologic laparoscopy 
      was associated with serious complications, and initial treatment with ureteral
      stenting was not useful. We advocate early open repair for those injuries.

TI  - Biomechanical comparison of syndesmosis fixation with 3.5- and 4.5-millimeter
      stainless steel screws.
PG  - 736-41
AB  - Although most authors recommend either 3.5-mm or 4.5-mm cortical screws for
      syndesmosis fixation, the optimum screw size has yet to be defined. The present
      study was designed to biomechanically compare syndesmosis fixation with 3.5-mm
      and 4.5-mm stainless steel screws. Simulated pronation external rotation ankle
      injuries were created in twelve paired, fresh-frozen cadaveric leg specimens. One
      limb from each pair received a 3.5-mm tricortical stainless steel screw for
      syndesmosis fixation (group I), while the contralateral specimen was stabilized
      using a 4.5-mm screw (group II). Sub-maximal axial ramp (0 to 1200 N) and
      external rotation/torsional ramp (0 to 5 N-m) loading was performed on each
      specimen prior to ligament division, following ligament division and following
      syndesmosis fixation. Axial fatigue testing was then performed at 1.5 Hz for a
      total of 100,000 cycles (0 to 900 N), and each specimen was subsequently tested
      to failure in external rotation. Ligament division resulted in syndesmosis
      widening (p<0.001) and reduced stiffness (p<0.001) during torsional ramp loading.
      Subsequent syndesmosis screw placement reduced syndesmosis widening (p<0.05) and 
      increased stiffness (p<0.05). Following screw fixation, however, widening
      remained greater (p<0.005) and stiffness less (p<0.001) than pre-injury levels.
      No differences between groups I and II were observed during submaximal testing.
      In external rotation to failure testing, group I failed at a greater angle (38.9 
      degrees +/- 4.1 degrees vs. 32.0 degrees +/- 3.8 degrees in group II; p<0.05).
      Failure torque was slightly higher in group I; however, the difference was not
      statistically significant (17.8 +/- 2.0 N-m vs. 14.3 +/- 2.6 N-m in group II;
      p=0.082). Five specimens in group I failed by screw pullout and five specimens in
      group II failed by fibula fracture (p=0.061). The present results suggest that
      there is no biomechanical advantage of a 4.5-mm screw over a 3.5-mm in fixation
      of the syndesmosis.

PG  - 207-10
AB  - The following article describes the efforts of a group of rural Vermont maternal 
      child health (MCH) nurses who addressed alcohol risk for the pregnant mothers
      they served through the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition
      program. As front-line providers, MCH nurses are in a position to both improve
      the detection of problem drinking during pregnancy and to strengthen maternal
      alcohol prevention and intervention initiatives. Results showed that a more
      refined screening for alcohol provided an opportunity to promote harm reduction.

TI  - Sleep and depression in cancer caregivers.
PG  - 410-5
AB  - A cross-sectional, correlational design was used to describe and explore the
      relation between caregiver sleep and depression. For the study, 51 caregivers
      were recruited from two sites in southern California. Caregivers were primarily
      white (84%), female (80%), spouses (61%), or adult children (29%), who had
      provided care for a mean of 16 hours per day for an average of 2 years. The
      Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D)and the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI) were used to measure caregiver depression and sleep,
      respectively. Most of the caregivers (95%) expressed severe sleep problems, and
      more than half of them were experiencing depressive symptoms at a level that
      would suggest risk for clinical depression. Correlations were strongest between
      caregiver depression and the sleep subscales of overall quality (r = 0.70; p <
      0.001), habitual sleep efficiency (r = 0.54; p < 0.001), and daytime dysfunction 
      (r = 0.59; p < 0.001). The final regression model, which included these
      subscales, predicted 63.6% of the variance in depression scores (F = 27.32; p <
      0.001). These findings, which are consistent with results from other studies,
      suggest that caregivers of persons with terminal illness are at risk for clinical
      depression. It is critical for nurses to be cognizant of the relation between
      sleep problems and depression, and to explore interventions that would allow the 
      caregivers to obtain needed sleep without diminishing their ability to function
      in their role as caregiver.

TI  - Are ictal vocalisations related to the lateralisation of frontal lobe epilepsy?
PG  - 244-7
AB  - The purpose was to analyse whether non-speech vocalisations in seizures
      originating in the frontal lobe do have lateralising value. Patients were
      included who had undergone presurgical evaluation with ictal video-EEG monitoring
      at the Epilepsy Centre, had had resective epilepsy surgery involving the frontal 
      lobe, and who had remained seizure free>1 year postoperatively. Twenty seven
      patients aged 1-42 years (mean 18) met the inclusion criteria. Age at epilepsy
      onset ranged from 1 month to 41 years (mean 7.1 years). All selected patients had
      a unilateral MRI detected lesion within the frontal lobe. Fifteen patients had
      right sided, 12 patients had left sided epileptogenic zones. Seizures recorded
      during EEG-video monitoring were re-evaluated to identify the occurrence of ictal
      vocalisations. Pure ictal vocalisations were distinguished from ictal sound
      productions due to motor or vegetative seizure activity (for example, cloni or
      respiratory sounds). Pure ictal vocalisation occurred in 11 patients of whom nine
      had a left frontal epileptogenic zone (p<0.01). It is concluded that ictal
      vocalisation could be an additional lateralising sign in frontal lobe epilepsy.
      The results suggest that not only speech, but vocalisation at a subverbal level
      also shows a left hemispheric dominance in humans.

TI  - Impact of patient characteristics, complications, and facility volume on the
      costs and time of cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty in 70
      catheterization laboratories.
PG  - 595-601
AB  - Although over 1 million procedures are performed in cardiac catheterization
      laboratories (CCLs) annually, little comparative data exist on costs or resource 
      use in these settings. In this study, data from 70 CCLs were used to profile CCL 
      times and total direct costs for 2 high-volume procedures: left heart
      catheterization (LHC) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
      with or without stent placement. In total, 70,677 consecutive patient
      examinations for a 12-month period from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 1998 were
      analyzed. For LHC mean total direct costs averaged $306, whereas for PTCA
      catheterization laboratory costs averaged $3,172. The average total times for
      these procedures were 63 and 108 minutes, respectively. Seventy-two percent of
      the PTCA patients underwent coronary stenting with an associated incremental cost
      of $1,244. By multivariate linear regression, baseline patient characteristics
      such as age, gender, and clinical factors had little impact on total time and
      total costs. The major determinants of CCL time and cost were procedural factors 
      (e.g., number and type of interventions) and in-lab complications, including
      profound hypotension, abrupt vessel closure, and emergency bypass surgery. Using 
      facility procedure volume as a proxy for potential economies of scale, we found
      no relation between CCL volume and total direct CCL costs. There did appear to be
      a significant inverse relation between facility volume and total procedural time 
      with CCLs that performed the highest volumes of LHC and PTCA procedures saving an
      average of 5 to 9 minutes per procedure. These findings may be useful in defining
      specific time and cost benchmarks for these commonly performed procedures and
      serve to underscore the critical role of reducing complications in both quality
      improvement and cost-saving efforts.

TI  - Potential to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing of commercial products marketed
      to reduce sudden infant death syndrome risk.
PG  - 774-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rebreathing of exhaled air is one proposed mechanism for the increased
      risk for sudden infant death syndrome among prone sleeping infants. We evaluated 
      how carbon dioxide (CO(2)) dispersal was affected by a conventional crib mattress
      and 5 products recently marketed to prevent prone rebreathing. SETTING: Infant
      pulmonary laboratory. EQUIPMENT: An infant mannequin with its nares connected via
      tubing to an 100-mL reservoir filled with 5% CO(2). The sleep surfaces studied
      included: firm mattress covered by a sheet, Bumpa Bed, Breathe Easy, Kid
      Safe/Baby Air, Halo Sleep System, and Sleep Guardian. The mannequin was
      positioned prone face-down or near-face-down. The sleep surfaces were studied
      with the covering sheet taut, covering sheet wrinkled, and with the mannequin arm
      positioned up, near the face. MEASUREMENTS: . We measured the fall in percentage 
      end-tidal CO(2) as the reservoir was ventilated with the piston pump. The
      half-time for CO(2) dispersal (t(1/2)) is an index of the ability to cause or
      prevent rebreathing. RESULTS: Compared with the face-to-side control, 5 of 6
      surfaces allowed a significant increase in t(1/2) in all 3 prone scenarios. The
      firm mattress and 4 of the 5 surfaces designed to prevent rebreathing
      consistently allowed t(1/2) above thresholds for the onset of CO(2) retention and
      lethal rebreathing in an animal model (J Appl Physiol. 1995;78:740). CONCLUSIONS:
      With very few exceptions, infants should be placed supine for sleep. For infants 
      placed prone or rolling to the prone position, significant rebreathing of exhaled
      air would be likely on all surfaces studied, except one.

TI  - Plasma, urinary, and salivary 8-epi-prostaglandin f2alpha levels in normotensive 
      and preeclamptic pregnancies.
PG  - 874-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to measure and compare plasma, urinary, and salivary
      concentrations of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (8-isoprostane) in women with
      normotensive pregnancies and the respective concentrations in pregnancies
      complicated by preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: Plasma, urinary, and salivary
      8-isoprostane levels were measured in pregnant women with preeclampsia (n = 40), 
      normotensive pregnant women (n = 20), and nonpregnant women (n = 10). One-way
      analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences. RESULTS:
      Plasma free 8-isoprostane concentrations were increased in women with severe
      preeclampsia (342 +/- 50 pg/mL), in comparison with nonpregnant women (129 +/- 17
      pg/mL) and normotensive pregnant women (150 +/- 11 pg/mL; P =.003, and.0001,
      respectively). Urinary excretion of 8-isoprostane was slightly but not
      significantly decreased in preeclampsia (1200 +/- 227 pg/mL), in comparison with 
      urinary excretion in nonpregnant women (1625 +/- 364 pg/mL) and normotensive
      pregnant women (2149 +/- 432 pg/mL). Salivary concentrations of 8-isoprostane
      were increased in normotensive women (496 +/- 113 pg/mL), in comparison with
      nonpregnant women (150 +/- 27 pg/mL) but were not related to preeclampsia (419
      +/- 96 pg/mL; P </=.003). CONCLUSION: Free 8-isoprostane concentrations are
      increased in the plasma of women with severe preeclampsia. Further studies are
      warranted to determine whether such increases are caused by an increase in
      phospholipase A(2) activity, or by lipid peroxidation, or by a decrease in renal 
      excretion.

TI  - Assessment of aortic line of elasticity using polynomial regression analysis.
PG  - 1819-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the sigmoid line of elasticity in
      the human aorta. METHODS AND RESULTS: The pressure-diameter relation was measured
      in the descending aorta in 120 subjects. In an additional group of 6 subjects,
      transient vena caval occlusion produced 5 sets of pressure-diameter data. We
      found that the best fit curve of the pooled pressure-diameter data was a
      third-order polynomial. A polynomial equation was used to calculate the sigmoid
      line of elasticity in the entire population and after the administration of
      diltiazem (15 patients) or enalaprilat (10 patients). The sigmoid line of
      elasticity was significantly different with respect to age (P<0.001), history of 
      hypertension (P<0.004), and hypercholesterolemia (P<0.02). The difference between
      the transition point and the peak systolic pressure was increased in normal
      subjects compared with patients (P<0.0001). The sigmoid line shifted leftward and
      upward with diltiazem, but it remained unchanged with enalaprilat. During an
      average of 3 years of follow-up, 19 of 88 patients developed stroke (n=4),
      unstable angina (n=8), acute myocardial infarction (n=4), or acute pulmonary
      edema (n=3). CONCLUSIONS: This approach provides a quantitative evaluation of the
      aortic line of elasticity, which can differentiate the intrinsic from the
      extrinsic aortic elastic properties. Furthermore, it is a powerful and
      independent risk factor for cardiovascular events.

TI  - Association of hepatitis B virus infection with other sexually transmitted
      infections in homosexual men. Omega Study Group.
PG  - 1570-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study determined the prevalence and factors associated with
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among men who have sex with men. METHODS: At
      the baseline visit of an HIV study among men who have sex with men, we asked
      about HBV vaccination status and tested for HBV markers. RESULTS: Of 625
      subjects, 48% had received at least 1 dose of HBV vaccine. Of 328 unvaccinated
      men, 41% had 1 or more HBV markers. HBV prevalence increased markedly with age
      and was associated with many sexual and drug-related behaviors. In a multivariate
      model, 7 variables were independently associated with HBV infection: ulcerative
      sexually transmitted diseases (odds ratio [OR] = 10.1; 95% confidence interval
      [CI] = 2.6, 54); injection drug use (OR = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.2, 26); gonorrhea or
      chlamydia (OR = 4.0; 95% CI = 1.9, 8.9); sexual partner with HIV/AIDS (OR = 3.6; 
      95% CI = 1.8, 7.1); 50 or more casual partners (OR = 3.4; 95% CI = 1.6, 7.1);
      received money for sex (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.2, 7.8); and 20 or more regular
      partners (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.1, 6.1). CONCLUSIONS: In Montreal, men who have
      sex with men are at risk for HBV infection, but a substantial proportion remain
      unvaccinated; new strategies are required to improve coverage. Men who have sex
      with men and who have a sexually transmitted infection, especially a
      genito-ulcerative infection, appear to be at particularly high risk for HBV
      infection.

TI  - Evoking analogue subtypes of panic attacks in a nonclinical population using
      carbon dioxide-enriched air.
PG  - 559-72
AB  - The increasing recognition that panic attacks are heterogeneous phenomena
      necessitates better and more objective criteria to define and examine what
      constitutes a panic attack. The central aim of the present study was to classify 
      subtypes of panic attacks (i.e. prototypic, cognitive, and non-fearful) in a
      nonclinical sample (N = 96) based on the concordance/discordance between
      subjective and physiological responding to multiple inhalations of 20 and 13%
      CO2-enriched air. Results show that a substantial proportion of this nonclinical 
      sample (55.2%) responded to the CO2 challenge in a manner consistent with
      clinical and research definitions of different subtypes of panic attacks. The
      implications of this dimensional approach for discriminating subtypes of panic in
      the laboratory are discussed as a means to better understand the phenomenology
      and nature of panic attacks.

TI  - Prevalence of dementia in centenarians.
PG  - 219-25
AB  - Above age 65, the prevalence of dementia rises exponentially from 1 to 15% at age
      85. Despite many studies concerning dementia, little is known about the
      prevalence of dementia in the 'oldest old'. Whether the prevalence levels off
      around age 95 is yet unanswered. This question is important because it addresses 
      whether dementia is an inevitable consequence of ageing or a disorder occurring
      within a specific age range. All 17 persons aged 100 or more in three Dutch towns
      with 250 000 inhabitants were examined by means of cognitive tests, informant
      questionnaires, clinical interviews and anamneses. Fifteen out of 17 Dutch
      centenarians in a complete population sample of 250 000 were found to be
      demented. Two could not be examined.

TI  - Cognitive outcome following pallidotomy: the influence of side of surgery and age
      of patient at disease onset.
PG  - 384-9
AB  - OBJECT: The authors studied the neuropsychological correlates of stereotactically
      guided lesioning of the right and left posteroventral globus pallidus internus
      (GPi) in a prospective series of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease
      (PD). METHODS: Eighteen patients with PD who underwent stereotactically guided
      lesioning of the GPi (left side in 10 patients and right side in eight) completed
      neuropsychological evaluations before and after surgery. Patients served as their
      own controls. Multiple two-by-two repeated-measures analyses of variance were
      used to assess neuropsychological changes as a function of the side in which
      lesioning was performed (lesioning on the left side compared with that on the
      right) and surgery (presurgery compared with postsurgery). Relationships between 
      cognitive variables and patient age at disease onset, age at surgery, and disease
      duration were examined using a linear regression model. The most striking
      findings were evident from results of a phonemic word fluency test in which
      patients in whom a left-sided pallidotomy had been performed achieved a mean
      performance score that was lower than the score of patients in whom a right-sided
      pallidotomy had been performed; this score declined even more as a result of
      surgery. Change in performance on the word fluency test across pre- and
      postoperative assessments was also related to patient age at onset of PD in those
      who had undergone left-sided pallidotomy, with patients of an older age at
      disease onset showing the greatest decline in performance. CONCLUSIONS: These
      preliminary findings indicate that the side on which surgery was performed and
      patient age at onset of PD are important in the prediction of postoperative
      cognitive outcome. The findings also indicate that stereotactically guided
      lesioning of the GPi presents a relatively mild cognitive risk.

TI  - Preventing pressure ulcers: an evaluation of four operating-table mattresses.
PG  - 134-41
AB  - Pressure is a major factor in the development of pressure ulcers. This research
      focused on assessing the pressure-reducing effects of operating-table mattresses.
      Five mattresses were tested: a standard operating-table mattress, a foam
      mattress, a gel mattress, a visco-elastic polyether mattress, and a visco-elastic
      polyurethane mattress. Four intraoperative postures were evaluated: supine,
      lateral, fossa, and the Miles-Pauchet position. Interface pressure measurements
      were performed on 36 healthy volunteers. The foam mattress and the gel mattress
      seem to have little or no pressure-reducing effect; the polyurethane mattress and
      the polyether mattress reduce interface pressure significantly better (p < .001);
      but none of the mattresses reduce pressure sufficiently to prevent the occurrence
      of pressure ulcers.

TI  - Vanadate enhances but does not normalize glucose transport and insulin receptor
      phosphorylation in skeletal muscle from obese women with gestational diabetes
      mellitus.
PG  - 1263-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the insulin-mimetic effects of vanadate, a
      protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, with the effects of insulin on skeletal
      muscle glucose transport and insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1
      phosphorylation to test the hypothesis that protein-tyrosine phosphatases
      participate in pregnancy-induced insulin resistance. STUDY DESIGN: Skeletal
      muscle fiber strips were obtained from the rectus abdominis during cesarean
      delivery in 7 patients with gestational diabetes mellitus, 11 pregnant women with
      normal glucose tolerance (pregnant control group), and 11 nonpregnant women
      undergoing elective surgery (nonpregnant control group). Muscle tissues were
      incubated in vitro for 15 to 60 minutes with or without maximal insulin (100
      nmol/L) or sodium vanadate (6 micromol/L). Insulin receptor and insulin receptor 
      substrate 1 tyrosine phosphorylation were measured, as was 2-deoxyglucose
      transport. The levels of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B were measured by Western
      blot analysis. RESULTS: Vanadate stimulated maximal 2-deoxyglucose transport more
      than did insulin alone in all samples (P<.05), but the value was still less in
      muscle tissues from pregnant control subjects and patients with gestational
      diabetes mellitus (P<.05). In muscle tissues from pregnant control subjects
      vanadate increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin
      receptor substrate 1 to levels similar to those in muscle tissues from
      nonpregnant control subjects. In patients with gestational diabetes mellitus
      vanadate increased insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine
      phosphorylation, but these values remained less than in muscle tissues from
      nonpregnant control subjects (P<.05). Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B levels were
      not significantly different in skeletal muscles from each group. CONCLUSION:
      Vanadate did not restore normal glucose transport activity during pregnancy
      complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus, which indicates that decreased
      glucose uptake is probably not caused by impaired tyrosine phosphorylation events
      alone. Increased serine kinase activity and impaired glucose transporter 4
      translocation probably contribute to insulin signaling abnormalities associated
      with pregnancy, especially in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Incidence and costs of 1987-1994 childhood injuries: demographic breakdowns.
PG  - E27
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Injuries pose a threat to health and well-being and are a major
      source of medical spending in the United States for children and youth 0 to 21
      years of age. This study provides national estimates of the incidence of fatal
      and nonfatal childhood injuries and comprehensive cost estimates by age, gender, 
      race, family income, metropolitan residence, and place of incident. METHODS:
      Eight years of National Health Interview Survey data (1987 to 1994) were used to 
      estimate nonfatal injury incidence rates among children and youth 21 years of age
      and younger. The survey documents all medically attended or temporarily disabling
      injuries within the 2 weeks before the interview. Injuries were defined as
      diagnoses 800-995 in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
      Revision, excluding late effects cases. Fatality counts came from 1994 Vital
      Statistics. Estimates of the costs of injuries (1994 US dollars) included medical
      spending, lost future work, and lost quality of life. Medical payments included
      spending on hospital and professional services, rehabilitation, prescriptions,
      home health care, and medical equipment. Lost future work and lost quality of
      life consisted of the present value of work that children will be unable to do as
      adults if they are killed or permanently disabled combined with the pain and
      suffering that children and their families experience because of the injury. Cost
      estimates excluded parental income losses from work missed, property damage,
      legal costs, and insurance claims-adjustment costs related to permanent
      disability and death. RESULTS: INCIDENCE. A total of 3,073 injury episodes for
      3,058 children were obtained from 8 years of National Health Interview Survey
      data. This represents 20.6 million children in the United States who were injured
      each year, or approximately 25 per 100 children. This translates to 56,000
      nonfatal injury episodes each day that require medical attention or limit
      children's activity. For fatal injuries, the rate was 38 children per 100,000.
      The nonfatal injury rate for males (mean: 30; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
      29,31) was higher than the rate for females (mean: 20; 95% CI: 19,21); the fatal 
      injury rate for males was more than twice that of females. Injury rates increased
      with age. Children 0 to 9 years of age had the lowest rate of nonfatal injury.
      Rates for nonfatal injury among children 0 to 4 years of age were lower (mean:
      20; 95% CI: 18,21) than those for the 5 to 9 age group (mean: 22; 95% CI: 20,
      23). However, the rate for fatal injuries (21 per 100,000) among the 0 to 4 age
      group was higher than the 5 to 9 age group (9 per 100,000). Nonfatal injury rates
      for children 10 years of age and older were higher, with the highest estimated
      injury rates in late adolescence (15-19 years; mean: 31; 95% CI: 29,33). Nonfatal
      injuries occurred at higher rates among white children (mean: 27; 95% CI: 26,28) 
      than black children (mean: 19; 95% CI: 17,21) or children from other racial
      backgrounds (mean: 13; 95% CI: 10,16). The reverse was true for fatal injuries,
      with higher fatality rates among black children (59 per 100,000). Children in
      families with incomes under $5,000 had the highest rate of nonfatal injury (mean:
      31; 95% CI: 27,35), followed by those in the $35,000 to $49,999 income range
      (mean: 25; 95% CI: 23,27). The rate of nonfatal injuries in the other income
      brackets were fairly similar, with those in the highest income bracket having the
      lowest rate (mean: 14; 95% CI: 13,15). Fatality rates by family income were not
      available. The nonfatal injury rate in nonmetropolitan areas (mean: 10; 95% CI:
      9,11) was higher than in metropolitan areas (mean: 8; 95% CI: 7,8); the same was 
      true for fatal injury rates (33 per 100,000 in nonmetropolitan areas vs 25 in
      metropolitan areas). Males consistently had higher injury rates than females
      across all places of injury. Youth 15 years of age and older had higher rates for
      injuries that occur on the public roads, in recreatio

TI  - Complex semantic processing in old age: does it stay or does it go?
PG  - 29-43
AB  - Old adults' (N = 24) and young adults' (N = 24) speed of producing exemplars of
      semantic categories (i.e., semantic fluency) varying in difficulty was assessed
      both in a standard condition and in a "set-switching" condition where exemplars
      had to be produced from 2 categories in an alternating manner.
      "Retrieval-position function" parameters were used to assess speed of semantic
      access independent of nonsemantic factors. Results suggested age effects in
      nonsemantic components but not in semantic retrieval per se. Also, age deficits
      in set switching were relatively subtle. Findings are discussed with relation to 
      issues of domain specificity of age effects as well as of the role of executive
      control during semantic retrieval and age differences therein.

TI  - Cardiovascular effects of an intravenous bolus of morphine in the ventilated
      preterm infant.
PG  - F101-3
AB  - AIM: To examine the cardiovascular effects of an intravenous bolus of morphine,
      100 microg/kg, in 17 ventilated preterm infants. METHODS: Heart rate and blood
      pressure were monitored. Right ventricular output, superior vena caval flow, and 
      the width of the ductus arteriosus were measured by Doppler echocardiography 10
      and 60 minutes after the morphine injection, and the values compared with
      baseline values by the paired t test. RESULTS: There was a small but significant 
      fall in heart rate (2.1% at 10 minutes, 4.3% at 60 minutes) consistent with a
      sedative effect. There was no effect on systolic, diastolic, or mean blood
      pressure. There was no significant effect on systemic blood flow as measured by
      either right ventricular output or superior vena caval flow. Ductal width was
      significantly reduced by a mean of 16% at 60 minutes, suggesting that normal duct
      closure was not inhibited. CONCLUSION: No cardiovascular effects of an
      intravenous bolus of morphine could be detected.

TI  - Roles of ICAM-1 for abnormal leukocyte recruitment in the microcirculation of
      bleomycin-induced fibrotic lung injury.
PG  - 1681-8
AB  - To assess the importance of endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1
      (ICAM-1) in microvascular leukocyte kinetics in diseased lungs, we investigated
      the transitional changes in ICAM-1 expression, vascular diameter, and leukocyte
      behavior in rat pulmonary microcirculation during the development of acute lung
      injury (ALI) and chronic fibrosis (FIB) evoked by bleomycin (BLM). Observations
      were made in the isolated perfused lung with a real-time confocal laser
      luminescence microscope. Microvascular cell kinetics were evaluated by measuring 
      the behavior of fluorescence- labeled leukocytes and erythrocytes in the presence
      or absence of anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody (1A29). Arteriolar ICAM-1 showed
      little change at any time after BLM treatment. Venular ICAM-1 was first enhanced 
      at the initial phase of ALI followed by the second upregulation at the early
      phase of FIB. Capillary ICAM-1 showed a sustained increase at both ALI and FIB.
      Arteriolar and venular diameters were not altered but capillary diameter
      decreased during ALI and early FIB stages. Although firm adherence of leukocytes 
      to arteriolar and venular walls was not observed, rolling leukocytes were
      increased in venules both at the initial phase of ALI and at the early phase of
      FIB. The leukocyte rolling in venules correlated well with transitional changes
      in ICAM-1 and was inhibited by 1A29. Sustained entrapment of leukocytes in
      capillaries was attributed to changes in vascular diameter as well as augmented
      ICAM-1. In conclusion, ICAM-1 plays an important role in microvascular leukocyte 
      recruitment in both ALI and FIB in the BLM-injured lung.

      September 24 to 25, 1998. Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver.
PG  - 49B-58B
AB  - This report summarizes a state-of-the-art workshop held in September 1998 on the 
      "Natural History and Outcome of Hepatitis C Infection". Sixteen Canadian and two 
      internationally renowned hepatologists were invited. A practical classification
      of HCV infection served as a framework for the meeting. The concepts of modelling
      of chronic disease, the epidemiology of HCV infection before the introduction of 
      anti-HCV testing, and the outcome of various forms of chronic hepatitis C in
      adults and children were presented. Lectures on the outcome of HCV cirrhosis,
      hepatocellular carcinoma, the role of liver transplantation, the influence of
      host factors on outcome, iron overload in chronic hepatitis C and possible

TI  - The Internet as a newly emerging risk environment for sexually transmitted
      diseases.
PG  - 443-6
AB  - CONTEXT: Transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with unprotected sex among
      multiple anonymous sex partners. The role of the Internet in risk of STDs is not 
      known. OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of STD transmission for persons who seek sex
      partners on the Internet with risk for persons not seeking sex partners on the
      Internet. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted September 1999 through April
      2000. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 856 clients of the Denver Public
      Health HIV Counseling and Testing Site in Colorado. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Self-report of logging on to the Internet with the intention of finding sex
      partners; having sex with partners who were originally contacted via the
      Internet; number of such partners and use of condoms with them; and time since
      last sexual contact with Internet partners, linked to HIV risk assessment and
      test records. RESULTS: Of the 856 clients, most were white (77. 8%), men (69.2%),
      heterosexual (65.3%), and aged 20 to 50 years (84. 1%). Of those, 135 (15.8%) had
      sought sex partners on the Internet, and 88 (65.2%) of these reported having sex 
      with a partner initially met via the Internet. Of those with Internet partners,
      34 (38.7%) had 4 or more such partners, with 62 (71.2%) of contacts occurring
      within 6 months prior to the client's HIV test. Internet sex seekers were more
      likely to be men (P<.001) and homosexual (P<.001) than those not seeking sex via 
      the Internet. Internet sex seekers reported more previous STDs (P =.02); more
      partners (P<.001); more anal sex (P<.001); and more sexual exposure to men
      (P<.001), men who have sex with men (P<.001), and partners known to be HIV
      positive (P<.001) than those not seeking sex via the Internet. CONCLUSIONS:
      Seeking sex partners via the Internet was a relatively common practice in this
      sample of persons seeking HIV testing and counseling (representative of neither
      Denver nor the overall US population). Clients who seek sex using the Internet
      appear to be at greater risk for STDs than clients who do not seek sex on the
      Internet. JAMA. 2000;284:443-446

TI  - Eating disordered patients: personality, alexithymia, and implications for
      primary care.
PG  - 21-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eating disorders are becoming more apparent in primary care.
      Descriptions of character traits related to people with eating disorders are
      rarely reported in the primary care literature and there is little awareness of
      the implications of alexithymia--a concept that defines the inability to identify
      or express emotion. We hypothesised that many individuals with active eating
      disorders have alexithymic traits and a tendency to somatize their distress. AIM:
      To analyse the character traits and degree of alexithymia of a selected group of 
      women with active eating disorders and in recovery, and to recommend responses by
      members of the primary care team that might meet the needs of such individuals.
      METHOD: Letters were sent to 200 female members of the Eating Disorders
      Association who had agreed to participate in research. Seventy-nine women
      volunteered to complete four postal questionnaires. This gave a response rate of 
      38.5%. Responders were categorised into three groups--anorexic, bulimic, and
      recovered--using the criteria of the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI-2). The
      results of the 16PF5 Personality Inventory (16PF5) and the Toronto Alexithymia
      Scale (TAS-20) were analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
      correlated using Pearson's correlation. A biographical questionnaire was also
      completed. RESULTS: In all three subgroups, high scores were achieved on the
      16PF5 on 'apprehension and social sensitivity', while there were significant
      differences in the scores for 'privateness': a scale that measures the ability to
      talk about feelings and confide in others. On the TAS-20, 65% of the anorexic and
      83% of the bulimic group scored in the alexithymic range compared with 33% of the
      recovered group. There was a significant negative correlation between alexithymia
      and social skills such as 'social and emotional expressivity' on the 16PF5.
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study emphasise the difference between those with
      active eating disorders who achieved high scores for privacy, introversion, and
      alexithymia, and those who have recovered. These character traits give potential 
      helpers an important indication of the areas that can both block and facilitate
      recovery, and they act as a reminder that the presenting symptoms in eating
      disorders and other psychosomatic conditions are the outward presentation of
      internal conflict. It is suggested that effective screening and needs assessment 
      will facilitate a more appropriate and prompt therapeutic response. This may be
      provided in the primary care setting where appropriate training has occurred.

TI  - The effect of kyphosis on the mechanical strength of a long-segment posterior
      construct using a synthetic model.
PG  - 1644-8
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This experimental study used synthetic spine models to compare the 
      effect of the angle of kyphosis, rod diameter, and hook number on the
      biomechanical stiffness of a long-segment posterior spinal construct. OBJECTIVE: 
      To examine the biomechanical effects of incremental kyphosis on variously
      instrumented long-segment posterior spinal constructs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND
      DATA: Euler's formula for loading of curved long columns would suggest that
      kyphosis has a profound impact on the biomechanical behavior of long-segment
      posterior spinal constructs. The effects of sagittal contour on the mechanical
      properties of long-segment posterior spinal constructs have not been well
      documented. METHODS: Kyphotic and straight synthetic spine models were used to
      test long-segment posterior instrumentation constructs biomechanically while
      varying rod diameter and the number of hook sites. The synthetic spines, composed
      of polypropylene vertebral blocks and isoprene elastomer intervertebral spacers, 
      were fabricated with either 0 degrees, 27 degrees, or 53 degrees of sagittal
      contour. The models were instrumented with 5.5- or 6.35-mm titanium rods, and
      with either 8 or 12 hooks. The models were loaded from 0 to 300 N in a cyclical
      ramp fashion using an MTS 858 Bionix testing device testing device. Construct
      stiffness (force and displacement) during axial compression was determined.
      RESULTS: Straight model: Changing the hook number from 8 to 12 caused a 32%
      increase in construct stiffness with the 5.5-mm rod. Changing the rod diameter
      from 5.5 to 6.35 mm caused a 36% increase in construct stiffness with the 8-hook 
      pattern. Changing both the rods and hooks caused the stiffness to increase 44%.
      27 degrees MODEL: Changing the hook number from 8 to 12 caused a 20% increase in 
      construct stiffness with the 6.5-mm rod. Changing the rod diameter from 5.5 to
      6.35 mm caused a 29% increase in construct stiffness with the 12-hook pattern.
      Changing both the rods and hooks caused the construct stiffness to increase 26%. 
      53 degrees MODEL: Changing the hook number from 8 to 12 caused a 14% increase in 
      construct stiffness with the 6.35-mm rod. Changing the rod diameter from 5.5 to
      6.35 mm caused a 17% (P<0.0005) increase in construct stiffness with the
      12-hookpattern. Changing both rods and hooks caused the stiffness to increase
      21%. Summary data on angular kyphosis: Using the same rod diameter and the same
      number of hooks, and progressing from a straight alignment to 27 degrees of
      sagittal contour decreased construct stiffness 32%. Going from straight alignment
      to 53 degrees decreased the stiffness 59.6%. All reported values were
      statistically significant (P < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical stiffness 
      of the straight spine was sensitive to both an increase in hook fixation sites
      and an increase in rod diameter. The kyphotic spines, however, were more
      sensitive to variations in rod diameter. Although with increasing kyphosis, the
      optimum instrumentation strategy will maximize both rod diameter and the number
      of hook sites, instrumented kyphotic spines remain biomechanically
      "disadvantaged" as compared with nonkyphotic instrumented spines.

TI  - Orthostatic hypotension as a risk factor for stroke: the atherosclerosis risk in 
      communities (ARIC) study, 1987-1996.
PG  - 2307-13
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association between orthostatic hypotension (OH) and 
      stroke has rarely been investigated in longitudinal studies. The purpose of the
      present study was to determine whether OH predicts ischemic stroke in a
      middle-aged, biethnic population after adjustment for known stroke risk factors. 
      Diastolic, systolic, and consensus OH were evaluated for baseline associations
      and for the ability to predict stroke. METHODS: In 11 707 persons from the
      Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort who were free of stroke and
      overt heart disease at baseline, Cox proportional hazards analyses modeled the
      association between OH at baseline and incident ischemic stroke over 7.9 years of
      follow-up. OH was defined as a systolic blood pressure drop >/=20 mm Hg (systolic
      OH), a diastolic blood pressure drop >/=10 mm Hg (diastolic OH), or a drop in
      either (consensus OH) when a person changed from a supine to standing position.
      RESULTS: OH was predictive of ischemic stroke, even after adjustment for numerous
      stroke risk factors (consensus OH: hazard ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.2). While 
      the baseline characteristics associated with OH varied depending on the type of
      OH, all types of OH had a similar risk of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: OH is an easily
      obtained measurement that may help to identify middle-aged persons at risk for
      stroke.

TI  - Expectant parents' anticipated changes in workload after the birth of their first
      child.
PG  - 993-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We hoped to evaluate gender differences in prenatal workload and
      anticipated prenatal to postpartum changes in workload for a group of expectant
      parents. METHODS: We included a total of 149 couples who were living together,
      expecting their first child, and enrolled in prenatal classes presented by 2
      metropolitan hospitals. The couples completed a prenatal survey containing
      information about demographic characteristics and prenatal work responsibilities 
      and a worksheet listing the number of hours per week that each partner planned to
      devote to various household, child care, and employment responsibilities at 6
      months postpartum. RESULTS: Though both men and women anticipated large increases
      in workload from the prenatal to the postpartum period, women expected greater
      increases (85% vs 53%). As a result of their greater anticipated involvement in
      household work and child care, women planned to work 9 hours more per week than
      men after the arrival of the baby. These expectant parents tended to occupy
      somewhat traditional gender work roles, with women contributing more time to
      cooking, cleaning, laundry, and shopping, and men devoting more time to lawn
      care, snow removal, household repairs, and employment. Men appeared to be more
      satisfied than women with their partner's contribution to household work
      (mean=6.0 and 5.4; P=.000). Partners' perceptions of how they shared household
      work were congruent, with 90% of the couples' summed congruency scores in the
      range within 1 point of a perfect match. CONCLUSIONS: Expectant parents in this
      study anticipated large increases in workload after childbirth. The projected
      work increases were greater for women than for men. It is interesting to note
      that these gender differences are anticipated even when couples were given an
      opportunity to systematically plan their postpartum work distribution together.

TI  - Comparison of risk of orthostatic hypotension in elderly depressed hypertensive
      women treated with nortriptyline and thiazides versus elderly depressed
      normotensive women treated with nortriptyline.
PG  - 1156-8, A9
AB  - This is a nonblind, case-controlled study comparing the risk of orthostatic
      hypotension (OH) in 2 groups of elderly depressed women: 22 normotensive and 21
      hypertensive patients receiving thiazides. Blood pressure measurements and
      tilt-table tests produced similar results: increased drop in systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) after standing (p <0.001), with no significant differences between
      the groups (p = 0.523). There were no changes on diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
      after standing, or in SBP or DBP at rest. Dizziness was reported by 23 subjects
      (53.5%) before treatment, and by 16 subjects (38.1%) at week 8. Complaints of
      dizziness were not associated with OH (Kappa = 0.07).

TI  - Scrub typhus encephalomyelitis with prominent focal neurologic signs.
PG  - 1770-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Encephalomyelitis with prominent focal neurologic signs and
      associated neuroradiologic abnormalities has not been previously described in
      scrub typhus. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 22-year-old woman was admitted because of fever
      and an altered mental state. Neurologic examination revealed bilateral sixth and 
      seventh nerve palsies, bilateral gaze evoked nystagmus, anarthria, dysphagia,
      quadriparesis, and sensory level at T1. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples
      were positive for tsutsugamushi antibody. The patient's magnetic resonance images
      demonstrated the lesions responsible for the neurologic dysfunctions: in the
      lower brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, and spinal cord. It was interesting that
      the gray matter of the spinal cord was predominantly involved. CONCLUSIONS: The
      recognition of unusual manifestations and the clinical suspicion of this
      treatment-responsive disease may be important, particularly in the face of
      increasing international and intranational travel.

PG  - 1984-5
AB  - A review of the susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from 4415
      episodes of infection in Scotland between 1991 and 1999 showed that the
      proportion of isolates with lowered susceptibility (ciprofloxacin minimum
      inhibitory concentration [MIC] > or = 0.05 mg/L) increased from 0.5% in 1991 to
      5% in 1999 (p<0.001), whereas the proportion of isolates with clinical resistance
      (ciprofloxacin MIC > or = 1 mg/L) was significantly higher in 1999 than the
      average for the preceding 4 years (2.2% vs 0.9%; p=0.02). Ciprofloxacin is a
      recommended treatment for gonococcal infection in the UK but if resistance
      continues to increase at the present rate it might not be suitable as a
      first-line treatment of gonorrhoea for much longer.

TI  - A comparison of levomethadyl acetate, buprenorphine, and methadone for opioid
      dependence.
PG  - 1290-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder with important
      public health implications. METHODS: In a 17-week randomized study of 220
      patients, we compared levomethadyl acetate (75 to 115 mg), buprenorphine (16 to
      32 mg), and high-dose (60 to 100 mg) and low-dose (20 mg) methadone as treatments
      for opioid dependence. Levomethadyl acetate and buprenorphine were administered
      three times a week. Methadone was administered daily. Doses were individualized
      except in the group assigned to low-dose methadone. Patients with poor responses 
      to treatment were switched to methadone. RESULTS: There were 55 patients in each 
      group; 51 percent completed the trial. The mean (+/-SE) number of days that a
      patient remained in the study was significantly higher for those receiving
      levomethadyl acetate (89+/-6), buprenorphine (96+/-4), and high-dose methadone
      (105+/-4) than for those receiving low-dose methadone (70+/-4, P<0.001).
      Continued participation was also significantly more frequent among patients
      receiving high-dose methadone than among those receiving levomethadyl acetate
      (P=0.02). The percentage of patients with 12 or more consecutive opioid-negative 
      urine specimens was 36 percent in the levomethadyl acetate group, 26 percent in
      the buprenorphine group, 28 percent in the high-dose methadone group, and 8
      percent in the low-dose methadone group (P=0.005). At the time of their last
      report, patients reported on a scale of 0 to 100 that their drug problem had a
      mean severity of 35 with levomethadyl acetate, 34 with buprenorphine, 38 with
      high-dose methadone, and 53 with low-dose methadone (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: As
      compared with low-dose methadone, levomethadyl acetate, buprenorphine, and
      high-dose methadone substantially reduce the use of illicit opioids.

TI  - Stepping performance during obstacle clearance in women: age differences and the 
      association with lower extremity strength in older women.
PG  - 1414-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare stepping performance during obstacle clearance in younger
      and older women, and to examine the relationship between lower extremity strength
      and stepping performance during obstacle clearance in older women. DESIGN:
      Correlational study. SETTING: A small community. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four older 
      women (mean age = 74.4), and 16 younger women (mean age = 20.7). The older
      participants lived independently in the community and were able to walk unaided. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Lower extremity muscle strength, measures of stepping performance
      including reaction time, movement time, extent of obstacle clearance, time to
      clear obstacle, among others. MAIN RESULTS: The older women were far slower in
      stepping than the younger women. Toe trajectories differed between older and
      younger women during the initial portion of the step. The younger women tended to
      lift the toe straight up, whereas the older women tended to move the toe
      backward, away from the obstacle, passing farther from the obstacle when the toe 
      cleared the obstacle height. There was little, if any, association between
      relative lower extremity strength and stepping performance during obstacle
      clearance in older women. CONCLUSIONS: Dramatic differences in the speed of
      volitional stepping performance were found between younger and older women. Among
      the older women, lower extremity strength was not related to volitional stepping 
      performance.

TI  - Delays in seeking HIV care due to competing caregiver responsibilities.
PG  - 1138-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe the characteristics of HIV-infected
      persons who delay medical care for themselves because they are caring for others.
      METHODS: HIV-infected adults (n = 2864) enrolled in the HIV Cost and Services
      Utilization Study (1996-1997) were interviewed. RESULTS: The odds were 1.6 times 
      greater for women than for men to put off care (95% confidence interval [CI] =
      1.2, 2.2); persons without insurance and with CD4 cell counts above 500 were also
      significantly more likely to put off care. Having a child in the household was
      associated with putting off care (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4, 2.3).
      CONCLUSIONS: Women or individuals with a child in the household should be offered
      services that might allow them to avoid delays in seeking their own medical care.

TI  - Mexiletine in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      mexiletine, a medication with antiarrhythmic, anticonvulsant and analgesic
      properties, in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder patients. METHODS: Twenty
      subjects with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder who had failed to respond or were
      intolerant to lithium, valproic acid and carbamazepine were entered into the
      6-week, open label study. Subjects were followed on a weekly basis for dosing of 
      mexiletine, blood levels, and completion of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
      (HAM-D) and the Manic State Rating Scale (MSRS). "Burden of Mood Symptoms" (BMS) 
      was calculated by combining scores for the HAM-D and MSRS. RESULTS: Thirteen
      subjects (10 female, 3 male), mean age 41 years (S.D.=7.6), and mean duration of 
      illness 20 years (S.D.=7.7) completed the study. The dose range of mexiletine was
      200-1200 mg/day. Full response (>/=50% reduction in BMS) was seen in 46% of the
      subjects, and a partial response (25-49% reduction in BMS) in 15%. Of note, 5/5
      subjects with a mixed or manic state demonstrated a full or partial response.
      LIMITATIONS: This study has an open label design, and a small number of subjects.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mexiletine may be effective and safe in patients with highly
      treatment-resistant, chronic bipolar disorder. Randomized, controlled trials are 
      required to confirm the current results.

TI  - Earlier initiation of antibiotic treatment for severe infections after
      interventions to improve the organization and specific guidelines in the
      emergency department.
PG  - 1317-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether combined interventions improve the timely
      administration of antibiotic therapy and acquisition of material for culture from
      patients admitted to the emergency department with a serious infectious disease. 
      METHODS: Guidelines and educational programs were developed to facilitate timely 
      antibiotic administration: guidelines on handling patients with serious
      infections and on ordering immediate treatment, guidelines on obtaining culture
      samples, lectures to medical and nursing staff, improvement of availability of
      antibiotics in the emergency department, and removal of financial restraints on
      stocking and ordering of antibiotics. Fifty consecutive patients were evaluated
      after this series of interventions and compared with the results in 50 patients
      evaluated before the interventions. The interval from presentation to the
      emergency department until the administration of antibiotics, number of samples
      taken for microbiological investigations, and number of patients receiving a
      first dose of antibiotic at routinely scheduled drug distribution rounds were
      evaluated. RESULTS: The median time to the initial dose of antibiotics
      administered decreased from 5.0 hours to 3.2 hours (P = .04). The number of blood
      cultures obtained did not change. The percentage of sputum cultures obtained
      increased from 28% to 50%, and the percentage of urine cultures obtained
      increased from 50% to 100%. The percentage of patients whose first dose of
      antibiotic was delayed until a routinely scheduled drug distribution round
      decreased from 54% to 32% (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Combined interventions to
      expedite diagnostic and therapeutic actions through directed clinical practice
      guidelines and organizational measures are successful. This may lead to a
      substantial quality improvement in the process of care.

TI  - Selective estrogen receptor modulators: structure, function, and clinical use.
PG  - 3172-86
AB  - The sex hormone estrogen is important for many physiologic processes. Prolonged
      stimulation of breast ductal epithelium by estrogen, however, can contribute to
      the development and progression of breast cancer, and treatments designed to
      block estrogen's effects are important options in the clinic. Tamoxifen and other
      similar drugs are effective in breast cancer prevention and treatment by
      inhibiting the proliferative effects of estrogen that are mediated through the
      estrogen receptor (ER). However, these drugs also have many estrogenic effects
      depending on the tissue and gene, and they are more appropriately called
      selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). SERMs bind ER, alter receptor
      conformation, and facilitate binding of coregulatory proteins that activate or
      repress transcriptional activation of estrogen target genes. Theoretically, SERMs
      could be synthesized that would exhibit nearly complete agonist activity on the
      one hand or pure antiestrogenic activity on the other. Depending on their
      functional activities, SERMs could then be developed for a variety of clinical
      uses, including prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, treatment and
      prevention of estrogen-regulated malignancies, and even for hormone replacement
      therapy. Tamoxifen is effective in patients with ER-positive metastatic breast
      cancer and in the adjuvant setting. The promising role for tamoxifen in ductal
      carcinoma-in-situ or for breast cancer prevention is evolving, and its use can be
      considered in certain patient groups. Other SERMs are in development, with the
      goal of reducing toxicity and/or improving efficacy, and future agents have the
      potential of providing a new paradigm for maintaining the health of women.

TI  - An endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase regulates endothelial
      adhesiveness for monocytes.
PG  - 2287-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)
      inhibits nitric oxide (NO) elaboration in cultured human endothelial cells and
      whether this is associated with the activation of oxidant-sensitive signaling
      mediating endothelial adhesiveness for monocytes. BACKGROUND: Endothelial NO
      elaboration is impaired in hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, which may be
      due to elevated concentrations of ADMA, an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase.
      METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV 304) and human monocytoid
      cells (THP-1) were studied in a functional binding assay. Nitric oxide and
      superoxide anion (O2-) were measured by chemiluminescence; ADMA by high pressure 
      liquid chromatography; monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) by ELISA and NF-KB 
      by electromobility gel shift assay. RESULTS: Incubation of endothelial cells with
      ADMA (0.1 microM to 100 microM) inhibited NO formation, which was reversed by
      coincubation with L-arginine (1 mM). The biologically inactive stereoisomer
      symmetric dimethylarginine did not inhibit NO release. Asymmetric
      dimethylarginine (10 microM) or native low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (100
      mg/dL) increased endothelial O2- to the same degree. Asymmetric dimethylarginine 
      also stimulated MCP-1 formation by endothelial cells. This effect was paralleled 
      by activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-KB. Preincubation of
      endothelial cells with ADMA increased the adhesiveness of endothelial cells for
      THP-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Asymmetric
      dimethylarginine-induced monocyte binding was diminished by L-arginine or by a
      neutralizing anti-MCP-1 antibody. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the endogenous
      NO synthase inhibitor ADMA is synthesized in human endothelial cells. Asymmetric 
      dimethylarginine increases endothelial oxidative stress and potentiates monocyte 
      binding. Asymmetric dimethylarginine may be an endogenous proatherogenic
      molecule.

TI  - Seasonal variation in suicides: diminished or vanished. Experience from England
      and Wales, 1982-1996.
PG  - 366-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seasonal variation in suicidal death has been observed in many
      countries. In particular, a cyclic variation was found for both men and women in 
      England and Wales in the 1960s and 1970s. Men showed a single 12-month cycle
      whereas women showed two cycles. AIMS: To re-examine the seasonal variation in
      suicides in England and Wales for the period 1982-1996. METHOD: A harmonic
      analysis was used to detect the seasonality of the suicide data. RESULTS: The
      seasonal effect on suicide is greatly diminished in England and Wales. This is
      shown by the reduced amplitude and smaller proportion of variance accounted for
      by the season. CONCLUSIONS: The seasonal effect on suicide has either diminished 
      or vanished.

OAB - PIP: In Ethiopia, obstetricians from Australia and New Zealand set up in 1975 the
      Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital to cater to women with fistula who were being turned
      away from local clinics. This kind of development assistance seems an ideal to be
      replicated--humane, skilled, practical, a mix of charitable and government aid,
      meeting an urgent clinical need, and enabling new knowledge to be passed on to
      locally trained doctors. However, the Fistula Hospital raises many troubling
      issues about its sustainability in a politically and economically unstable
      environment. It is important to recognize that the needs of Third World societies
      are completely different from their Western counterparts. Part of the problem
      lies in the unequal power relationship, availability of research funding, trained
      scientists, information, and equipment. Moreover, the highjacking of clinical and
      research agendas by Western organizations causes profound insult to the poor
      countries. Overall, it is noted that research is a significant means of achieving
      a sustainable health infrastructure. It is essential that development be viewed
      as a respectful dialogue and not the colonization of the imagination of other
      societies. Development, in this formulation, is not only development as freedom
      from deprivation and oppression but also the development of a common horizon or
      perspective.

TI  - Implications of species difference for clinical investigation: studies on the
      renin-angiotensin system.
PG  - 150-4
AB  - The justification for clinical investigation has its roots in the fact that
      physiological mechanisms and disease pathogenesis in animal models replicate
      mechanisms and pathogenesis in humans only in part. In the case of the
      renin-angiotensin system, there is species variation in the anatomic distribution
      of the renin-angiotensin system, in the active site of the renin enzyme, and in
      the structure of angiotensin and the AT(1) receptor. The conversion of
      angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II) may prove to be the most
      important aspect of species variation. In plasma, all the conversion occurs
      through a single enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and species
      variation in structure and function have not been reported. Non-ACE-dependent
      pathways, which occur only at the tissue level, show unambiguous, striking
      species variation. Specifically, chymase, the most important enzyme responsible
      for non-ACE conversion of Ang I to Ang II, shows striking species variation. In
      humans and a number of species, including the hamster, quantitatively important
      chymase-independent Ang II formation from Ang I occurs in the heart, arteries,
      and kidney. In rats and rabbits, on the other hand, chymase differs, is not
      active in the conversion of Ang I to Ang II, and indeed is involved in Ang II
      degradation. Consequently, one would anticipate that blockade of the system at
      the ACE step would be equivalent to that at the Ang II receptor in the rat. This 
      has been widely reported. In humans, on the other hand, one would anticipate that
      the AT(1) receptor blockers will be more effective than ACE inhibitors. Again,
      preliminary evidence favors this possibility. The implications for therapeutics
      are clear.

TI  - Evaluation of guidelines for the use of telemetry in the non-intensive-care
      setting.
PG  - 51-5
AB  - To determine if the American College of Cardiology (ACC) cardiac monitoring
      guidelines accurately stratify patients according to their risks for developing
      clinically significant arrhythmias in non-intensive-care settings, we conducted a
      prospective cohort study of 2,240 consecutive patients admitted to a
      non-intensive-care telemetry unit over 7 months. Sixty-one percent of patients
      were assigned to ACC class I (telemetry indicated in most patients), 38% to class
      II (telemetry indicated in some), and 1% to class III (telemetry not indicated). 
      Arrhythmias were detected in 13.5% of the class I patients, 40.7% of the class II
      patients, and 12% of the class III patients (p <.001). Telemetry detected an
      arrhythmia resulting in transfer to an intensive care unit in 0.4% of the class I
      patients, 1.6% of the class II patients, and none of the class III patients (p
      =.006). Telemetry led to a change in management for 3.4% of the class I patients,
      12.7% of the class II patients, and 4% of the class III patients (p <.001). When 
      patients with chest pain as the reason for admission were moved from class I to
      class II and patients with arrhythmias as the reason for admission were moved
      from class II to class I, more arrhythmias and more clinically significant
      arrhythmias occurred in class I patients and the trends from class I to class III
      were more consistent with the purpose of the guidelines. These findings indicate 
      that when the ACC guidelines are reexamined, consideration should be given to
      changing them so they are more useful in non-intensive-care settings.

TI  - A comprehensive program to improve safety for pregnant women and fetuses in motor
      vehicle crashes: a preliminary report.
PG  - 1554-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A program was developed to study the mechanisms of abruptio placentae 
      and pregnancy loss caused by motor vehicle crashes. The results were intended to 
      be used to develop strategies to improve protection of the fetus in this setting.
      STUDY DESIGN: Four integrated projects were conducted: (1) seated anthropometric 
      measurements and belt fit determination during pregnancy, (2) development of new 
      models of traumatic abruptio placentae, (3) investigations of crashes involving
      pregnant women, and (4) the development of the second-generation pregnant crash
      dummy from these data and others. RESULTS: Twenty-two different pregnant subjects
      in five different height groups underwent serial measurements of abdominal
      surface contours, seat belt fit, and distances between the subjects and various
      landmarks in the automobile interior with a laboratory-designed "automobile seat"
      (seating buck). The abdomen was significantly closer to the steering wheel in the
      shorter stature group than among the taller women. Beginning at approximately 20 
      weeks' gestation the fundus of the uterus was above the lower rim of the steering
      wheel. Lap belts fit properly over the anterior superior iliac spine throughout
      gestation, but the lap belt overlapped the uterus in the midsagittal plane. Two
      separate mechanisms for traumatic abruptio placentae were tested: shear failure
      and tensile failure. In the shear failure model large circumferential strains in 
      the uterine wall induce a shear strain across the uteroplacental interface, and
      the model predicts placental separation at a mean circumferential strain of -58% 
      +/- 8%. By means of finite-element modeling, it was demonstrated that tensile
      failure might also be a mechanism that causes abruptio placentae during rapid
      deceleration of the uterus. Crash investigations were performed in 43 cases
      involving pregnant women beyond 20 weeks' gestation. There were a total of 8
      fetal losses and 8 major complications (fetal survival with abruptio placentae,
      direct fetal injury, or preterm delivery before 34 weeks' as a result of the
      accident). The best predictors of fetal loss or adverse outcome were impact
      severity and proper seat belt use. With these newly acquired data a
      second-generation crash dummy, known as the Maternal Anthropomorphic Measurement 
      Apparatus version 2b (MAMA-2b), is being developed. It incorporates strain gauges
      in the fundal region of the fluid-filled uterus plus pressure transducers in both
      the anterior and posterior uterus. Criteria are being developed to associate the 
      likelihood of abruptio placentae with measurements from these instruments that
      correspond to the two major hypothesized mechanisms of abruptio placentae.
      CONCLUSION: An improved understanding of the elements of automobile crashes that 
      cause fetal loss and other major pregnancy complications has been gained through 
      this series of investigations.

TI  - Patient care guidelines in pediatrics.
PG  - 859-60
AB  - The increase in availability of patient care guidelines is consistent with the
      expansion of managed care health care systems and enhanced efforts of health care
      providers to deliver evidence-based patient care. When used effectively,
      guidelines support: 1) the reduction of unexplained variation in health care
      practice; 2) education of practitioners and health care delivery systems; and 3) 
      the continuous improvement in processes that improve patient outcomes. It is with
      these goals in mind that Milliman and Robertson released its latest publication
      of Health Care Management Guidelines entitled Pediatric Health Status Improvement
      and Management (HSIM). This publication contains comprehensive information on
      many aspects of pediatric care, from the prenatal period through adolescence,
      from preventive medicine through chronic care. Like other Milliman and Robertson 
      Health Care Management Guidelines publications, Pediatric HSIM offers both
      treatment guides and benchmarks that enable health care professionals to provide 
      optimal levels of care and to measure their performance against peers. The
      primary focus of Pediatric HSIM is on wellness across a child's lifetime, an
      objective that fits well with our goal as providers of care to children of
      keeping patients healthy through preventive medicine.

TI  - Activation of adenosine A1-receptor pathway induces edema formation in the
      pancreas of rats.
PG  - 829-36
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adenosine has been shown to modulate various pathophysiologic 
      conditions through receptor-mediated mechanisms. However, the role of adenosine
      in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis has not been described. We examined the
      effect of adenosine-receptor stimulation or inhibition on the pathologic changes 
      of the pancreas. METHODS: Rats received intraperitoneal injections of selective
      agonists of A1, A2a, and A3 adenosine receptors:
      2-chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA), CGS-21680 (CGS), or
      1-deoxy-1-[6-[[(3-iodophenyl)methyl]amino]-9H-purin-9-yl]-N-methyl-be
      ta-D-ribofuranuronamide (IB-MECA), respectively. Serum amylase activity and
      pathologic changes of the pancreas were evaluated. The effects of a specific
      A1-receptor antagonist (FK-838) on the pathologic findings of cerulein- and
      taurocholate-induced pancreatitis were also examined. RESULTS: Administration of 
      a selective A1 agonist induced hyperamylasemia and morphologic changes in the
      pancreas characterized by interstitial edema and leukocyte infiltration; neither 
      A2a nor A3 agonist produced such changes. Treatment with an A1-receptor
      antagonist significantly attenuated the outcome induced by A1 agonist
      stimulation. In addition, the A1-receptor antagonist significantly ameliorated
      pancreatic edema in both pancreatitis models, although it did not improve the
      acinar cell damage of the pancreas or the increase of serum amylase. CONCLUSIONS:
      Activation of the adenosine A1-receptor pathway may have an important role in the
      pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis.
